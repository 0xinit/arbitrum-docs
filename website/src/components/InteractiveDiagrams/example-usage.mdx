## How Timeboost Works

Timeboost is a feature that allows users to participate in auctions for priority transaction processing on Arbitrum chains. The auction process consists of several steps:

1. **Deposit funds** - Users deposit funds into the auction contract
2. **Submit bids** - Users submit bids for specific auction rounds
3. **Auctioneer response** - The auctioneer validates bids and responds
4. **Submit winning bids** - The auctioneer submits winning bids to resolve the auction
5. **Priority processing** - The sequencer prioritizes auction contract calls

For more detailed information, see the [Timeboost documentation](https://docs.arbitrum.io/run-arbitrum-node/how-to-use-timeboost).
