# Step 1: Deposit funds into the auction contract

Users must first deposit ERC-20 tokens into the auction contract to participate in bidding.

1. Call `submitDeposit()` on the IExpressLaneAuction contract
2. The contract emits a DepositSubmitted event with the bidder's address and amount
3. Funds are now available for bidding in future auction rounds

```solidity
function submitDeposit(uint256 amount) external;
```

# Step 2: `timeboost_submitBid()`

Users submit bids through the auctioneer's RPC API for the upcoming round.

1. Create a bid with chain ID, round number, and bid amount
2. Sign the bid data with your private key
3. Submit the bid via timeboost_submitBid RPC method

```javascript
{
  chain_id: "uint64",
  address: "0x...",
  round: "uint64",
  amount: "uint256",
  signature: "0x..."
}
```

# Step 3: Auctioneer Response

The auctioneer validates the bid and responds with success or failure.

1. Auctioneer verifies chain ID, round number, and signature
2. Checks if sender is a depositor with sufficient balance
3. Returns status OK or an error code if validation fails

```javascript
{
  status: "OK" | "ERROR",
  error?: "MALFORMED_DATA" | "NOT_DEPOSITOR" | "WRONG_CHAIN_ID" | "WRONG_SIGNATURE" | "BAD_ROUND_NUMBER" | "INSUFFICIENT_BALANCE"
}
```

# Step 4: `auctioneer_submitBidAuctionTransaction`

The auctioneer submits the winning bids to resolve the auction.

1. Auctioneer collects and sorts all valid bids for the round
2. Identifies the two highest bids
3. Calls resolveAuction() with the winning bids

```solidity
function resolveAuction(Bid calldata bid1, Bid calldata bid2) external;
```

# Step 5: Sequencer prioritizes the auction contract calls

The sequencer ensures timely processing of auction-related transactions.

1. Auction resolution transactions get priority processing
2. Winner is declared as express lane controller for the round
3. Second-highest bid amount is deducted from winner's balance
4. AuctionResolved event is emitted with the results

```solidity
event AuctionResolved(
    uint256 winningBidAmount,
    uint256 loserBidAmount,
    address indexed winningBidder,
    uint256 indexed winnerRound
);
```
