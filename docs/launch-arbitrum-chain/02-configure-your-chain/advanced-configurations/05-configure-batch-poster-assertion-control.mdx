This guide explains the configurations available for batch posting, managed by the batch poster, and assertion posting, handled by validators, on an Arbitrum Orbit chain. These configurations are essential for ensuring efficient transaction processing, maintaining chain integrity, and preventing issues such as transaction reordering and chain reorganizations.

Batch posting configurations allow the sequencer to group, compress, and post transaction batches from the Arbitrum chain (L3) to its parent chain (typically an L2 such as Arbitrum One or Nova). Key parameters include the maximum delay before posting a batch, which controls the frequency and timeliness of postings. These help prevent transaction reordering by ensuring that the sequencer commits batches in the order transactions are received, posting them atomically to the parent chain's inbox contract. This batch posting creates an immutable record on L1 (via the L2), reducing the risk of malicious reordering. For chain reorganizations, timely batch posting minimizes the window for L1 reorgs to affect unposted data, as posted batches become part of the canonical chain history.

Assertion posting configurations enable validators to periodically create and post assertions (state roots) of the Arbitrum chain's execution to the parent chain. Parameters control the interval between assertions and staking requirements. These prevent reordering and reorgs by allowing any honest validator to challenge incorrect assertions during a dispute window (typically seven days on Arbitrum chains). Regular assertions ensure state commitments are frequent enough to detect discrepancies early, triggering onchain resolution via bisection games, which enforce the correct chain state and deter reorganizations.

## Batch Posting Minimum Frequency: Maximum Wait Time to Post a Batch

The batch posting minimum frequency is primarily controlled by the `--node.batch-poster.max-delay` parameter in the [Nitro node's configuration](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/arbnode/batch_poster.go) (set via the JSON config file or command-line flags when deploying an Orbit chain). This parameter defines the maximum time the batch poster will wait after receiving a transaction before posting a batch that includes it. The default value is one hour (3600 seconds).

- **Configuration Options**: Set this in the `node.batch-poster` section of the config, e.g., `"max-delay": "30m"` for a 30-minute maximum wait. Lower values increase posting frequency but may result in smaller, less efficient batches during periods of low activity, thereby increasing gas costs on the parent chain. If no transactions are received, no batches will post regardless of this setting.
- **Prevention of Issues**: A shorter max delay reduces the opportunity for transaction reordering by minimizing the time transactions sit uncommitted in the sequencer's mempool. It also limits exposure to chain reorgs, as batches post sooner, anchoring them to the parent chain before potential L1 fluctuations can invalidate sequencing. However, extremely low settings (e.g., seconds) could spam the parent chain with tiny batches, resulting in increased costs without significant benefits.
- **Recommended Settings**: For high-throughput chains, set to 5-15 minutes to balance latency and efficiency. For low-activity chains, stick to the default one hour to avoid unnecessary postings.

## Validator Node Creation Frequency: Interval Between Validator Assertions

The validator assertion posting frequency is controlled by the `--node.staker.make-assertion-interval` parameter in the Nitro node's configuration. This parameter sets the minimum time to wait since the last assertion before posting a new one (if the validator configuration is to make new assertions via the `MakeNodes` strategy). The default value is one hour (3600 seconds). This interval must always exceed the rollup contract's `minimumAssertionPeriod`, which defaults to 75 L1 blocks (approximately 15 minutes at 12-second block times).

- **Configuration Options**: Configure this in the `node.staker` section, e.g., `"make-assertion-interval": "45m"` for a 45-minute interval. Validators also require staking (bonding `ETH` or tokens on the parent chain) to post assertions, with the minimum stake set via the rollup contract during chain deployment. If an incorrect assertion is detected, the interval is bypassed, and a new challenge begins. No new assertions get posted if no new batches arrive or force inclusions occur.
- **Prevention of Issues**: Frequent assertions ensure the chain's state is regularly committed and verifiable on the parent chain, preventing reordering by allowing disputes over any manipulated transaction order. For reorganizations, assertions serve as checkpoints; if a reorganization affects prior batches, validators can challenge and resolve the state to the correct one, thereby maintaining integrity. Infrequent assertions could widen the dispute window vulnerability, but the default balances this with efficiency.
- **Recommended Settings**: Set to 20-30 minutes for chains needing low-latency finality, but ensure it's >15 minutes to comply with the minimum period. Higher values (e.g., two hours) are suitable for low-stakes chains to reduce validator operational costs.

## Reorg Resistance Margin

The reorganization resistance margin is configurable via the `--node.batch-poster.reorg-resistance-margin` parameter, which specifies a time duration (e.g., in minutes) during which the batch poster will avoid posting batches if their minimum L1 block number or timestamp is too close to the current L1 head. This margin serves as a safety buffer to prevent posting batches that reference recent L1 states, which are prone to reorganization. The default value is ten minutes (600 seconds), based on observed usage in deployments and error logs.

- **Detailed Explanation of the Message**: The message "Disabling batch posting due to batch being within reorg resistance margin from layer 1 minimum block or timestamp bounds" signifies that the batch poster's logic has detected the proposed batch's minimum required L1 block or timestamp falls within the configured margin of the current L1 chain head.

For example, if the margin is ten minutes and the L1 head timestamp is `T`, the poster disables itself if the batch requires a minimum timestamp greater than (`T - 10m`) or a minimum block that is too close to the head. This message serves as a protective mechanism: L1 chains, such as Ethereum, can undergo short reorganizations (e.g., uncle blocks or brief forks), which could invalidate a posted batch if it references a block/timestamp that gets reorganized.

By temporarily disabling posting, the system waits for L1 to stabilize, ensuring the batch remains valid once posted. The disablement is transient; posting resumes once the margin clears (e.g., as L1 advances).

This message often appears in logs during periods of high L1 volatility or when the sequencer's clock/L1 sync is slightly off. It's normal in such cases, but it may indicate setup issues if it persists.
- **Guidance on Configuration**: Set this in the `node.batch-poster` config section, e.g., `"reorg-resistance-margin": "5m"`. Lower values allow for faster posting but increase the risk; higher values enhance safety. Monitor logs for frequent disablements and adjust accordingly based on the parent chain stability (e.g., Ethereum mainnet vs. testnets).
- **Recommended Settings**: The default of ten minutes is suitable for most Orbit chains settling to Arbitrum One/Nova, as Ethereum reorgs rarely exceed a few blocks (1-2 minutes). For chains on more volatile bases (e.g., alt L1s), increase the time to 15-20 minutes. Test on devnets to observe behavior.
- **Trade-offs Between Consistency and Latency**: A higher margin prioritizes consistency by reducing the chance of orphaned posted batches due to L1 reorgs, which could force manual intervention or state rollbacksâ€”critical for high-value chains. However, it increases latency, as batches may wait longer to post, delaying confirmation times (e.g., from seconds to minutes). A lower margin reduces latency for a better user experience (faster transaction finality) but risks more frequent disablements or invalid postings, potentially leading to temporary chain halts or increased operational overhead. Balance based on chain use case: low margin for gaming/dex chains that require speed; high margin for DeFi/financial apps that emphasize reliability.
