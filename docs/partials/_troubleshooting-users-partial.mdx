### Why do I need ETH to use the Arbitrum network?

<p>
  <code>{'ETH'}</code> is the currency used to pay gas fees on Arbitrum, and it powers all
  transactions on Arbitrum. You can bridge <code>ETH</code> (and other tokens) from Ethereum to
  Arbitrum through <a href="https://bridge.arbitrum.io/">Arbitrum's bridge</a>.
</p>

<p>

</p>

### Do I need to pay a tip or priority fee for my Arbitrum transactions?

<p>
  Transaction processing occurs in the order that the Sequencer receives them; no priority fee is
  necessary for Arbitrum transactions. If a transaction includes a priority fee, the origin address
  of the transaction will be refunded at the end of execution.
</p>

### How can I see the balance of ETH and other tokens in my wallet on Arbitrum?

<p>
  Most wallets are "connected" to one given network at a time. To view your ETH or token balances,
  ensure that you have an established connection to the appropriate Arbitrum chain. In MetaMask and
  OKX Wallet, you can switch networks via the <strong>Networks</strong> drop-down. In this
  drop-down, please select the desired network (either Arbitrum One or Arbitrum Nova for our mainnet
  networks). If your preferred network hasn't been added to your wallet yet, you can add it via the{' '}
  <a href="https://bridge.arbitrum.io/">Arbitrum Bridge</a>.
</p>

<p>

</p>

### What happens if I send my funds to an exchange that doesn't support Arbitrum?

<p>
  If you send the funds and the receiving wallet/exchange doesn't support the Arbitrum network you
  are sending funds through, unfortunately, there is nothing we can do to recover your funds. You
  would need to contact the wallet/exchange support and see if they can assist you in retrieving the
  funds.
</p>

<p>

</p>

### Does Arbitrum have a mempool?

<p>
  The Arbitrum Sequencer orders transactions on a first-come, first-served basis. The Sequencer
  inserts transactions into a queue based on the order in which they are received and executes them
  accordingly, which eliminates the need for a mempool. The Sequencer's queue has no space limit;
  transactions on the queue will eventually timeout and get discarded if not executed within a
  reasonable timeframe. Under normal conditions, the queue is empty, as transaction execution occurs
  nearly instantaneously.
</p>

<p>

</p>

### What's the difference between Arbitrum Rollup and Arbitrum AnyTrust?

<p>
  Arbitrum Rollup is an Optimistic Rollup protocol; it is trustless and permissionless. Part of how
  these properties are achieved is by requiring all chain data to be posted on layer 1. This means
  the availability of this data follows directly from the security properties of Ethereum itself,
  and, in turn, that any party can participate in validating the chain and ensuring its safety. For
  more information, see{' '}
  <a href="https://docs.arbitrum.io/inside-arbitrum-nitro/">Inside Arbitrum Nitro</a>.
</p>

<p>
  By contrast, Arbitrum AnyTrust introduces a trust assumption in exchange for lower fees; data
  availability is managed by a Data Availability Committee (DAC), a fixed, permissioned set of
  entities. We introduce some threshold, <code>K</code>, with the assumption that at least{' '}
  <code>K</code> members of the committee are honest. For simplicity, we'll hereby assume a
  committee of size 20 and a <code>K</code> value of 2:
</p>

<p>
  If 19 out of the 20 committee members <em>and</em> the Sequencer are malicious and colluding
  together, they can break the chain's safety (and, e.g., steal users' funds); this is the new trust
  assumption.
</p>

<p>
  If anywhere between 2 and 18 of the committee members are well behaved, the AnyTrust chain
  operates in "Rollup mode"; i.e., data gets posted on L1.
</p>

<p>
  In what should be the common and happy case, however, in which at least 19 of the 20 committee
  members are well behaved, the system operates without posting the L2 chain's data on L1, and thus,
  users pay significantly lower fees. This is the core upside of AnyTrust chains over rollups.
</p>

<p>
  Variants of the AnyTrust model in which the new trust assumption is minimized are under
  consideration; stay tuned.
</p>

<p>
  For more, see <a href="https://developer.arbitrum.io/inside-anytrust">Inside AnyTrust</a>.
</p>

<p>

</p>

### How can I check the status of my cross chain message?

<p>
  You can check the status of <em>any </em>Arbitrum cross chain message at 
  <a href="https://retryable-dashboard.arbitrum.io/">
    https://retryable-dashboard.arbitrum.io/
  </a> (you will also be able to execute the cross chain message there, if applicable).
</p>

<p>
  You'll need the transaction hash of the "initiating transaction": the L1 transaction hash for an
  L1-to-L2 message (e.g., a deposit), or the L2 transaction hash for an L2-to-L1 message (e.g., a
  withdrawal).
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
  If you cross-chain message was initiated from{' '}
  <a href="https://bridge.arbitrum.io/">https://bridge.arbitrum.io/</a>, you can also check its
  status / execute it at that site in the transaction history tab.
</p>

<p>

</p>

### If there is a dispute, can my L2 transaction get reorged / thrown out / "yeeted"?

<p>
  Nope; once an Arbitrum transaction is included on L1, there is no way it can be reorged (unless
  the L1 itself reorgs, of course). A "dispute" involves Validators disagreeing over execution,
  i.e., the outputted state of a chain. The inputs, however, can't be disputed; they are determined
  by the Inbox on L1. (See 
  <a href="https://developer.arbitrum.io/tx-lifecycle">Transaction Lifecycle</a>)
</p>

<p>

</p>

### ...okay but if there's a dispute, will my transaction get delayed?

<p>
  The only thing that a dispute can add delay to is the confirmation of L2-to-L1 messages. All other
  transactions continue to be processed, even while a dispute is still ongoing. (Additionally, in
  practice, most L2-to-L1 messages represent withdrawals of fungible assets; these can be
  trustlessly completed <em>even during a dispute</em> via trustless fast "liquidity exit"
  applications. See 
  <a href="https://developer.arbitrum.io/arbos/l2-to-l1-messaging">L2-to-L1 Messages</a>).
</p>

<p>

</p>

### Are "Sequencers" the same entities as "Validators"? Can a centralized Sequencer act maliciously (e.g., steal all my money)?

<p>No and no!</p>

<p>
  An Arbitrum Chain's Sequencer(s) and Validators and completely distinct entities, with their own
  distinct roles.
</p>

<p>
  The <a href="https://developer.arbitrum.io/sequencer">Sequencer</a> is the entity granted specific
  privileges over ordering transactions; once the Sequencer commits to an ordering (by posting a
  batch on Ethereum), it has no say over what happens next (i.e., execution). A malicious/faulty
  Sequencer can do things like reordering transactions or <em>temporarily</em> delaying a
  transaction's inclusion — things which could be, to be sure, annoying and bad — but can do nothing
  to compromise the chain's safety.
</p>

<p>
  The <em>Validators</em> are the ones responsible for the safety of the chain; i.e., making staked
  claims about the chain state, disputing each other, etc.
</p>

<p>
  Currently, on Arbitrum One, the Sequencer is a centralized entity maintained by Offchain Labs.
  Eventually, we expect the single Sequencer to be replaced by a distributed committee of Sequencers
  who come to consensus on transaction ordering. This upgrade will be an improvement; we don't want
  you to have to trust us not to reorder your transactions. However, it also isn't <em>strictly</em>
   necessary for Arbitrum One to achieve its most fundamental properties.
</p>

<p>
  In other words: 
  <em>
    <strong>
      An Arbitrum Rollup chain with a centralized Sequencer could theoretically still be trustless!
    </strong>
  </em>
</p>

<p>
  Which is to say — the more important thing than decentralizing the Sequencer, i.e., the thing you
  ought to care more about — is decentralizing the <em>Validators</em>.
</p>

<p>
  Arbitrum One's validator set is currently allowlisted; over time, we expect 
  <a href="https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/">governance</a> to expand the allowlist and eventually be
  removed entirely.
</p>

<p>

    "State of Progressive Decentralization"
  </a>.
</p>

<p>

</p>

### Why was "one week" chosen for Arbitrum One's dispute window?

<p>
  The expectation is that one week should be sufficient for validators to conduct an interactive
  dispute, provided they do not face challenges in getting their transactions included on Layer 1.
  The one-week decision occurred following a consensus among the Ethereum research community and
  other Layer 2 projects. The intention is to allow the community sufficient time to coordinate
  socially in the event of a coordinated Ethereum staker censorship attack.
</p>

<p>

### Are there any Fiat on-ramps that support Arbitrum?

<p>
  Yes, you can find a list of Fiat on-ramps that support Arbitrum{' '}

</p>

<p>

</p>

### How many blocks are needed for a transaction to be confirmed/finalized in Arbitrum?

<p>
  There are two levels of finality in a{' '}
  <a href="https://developer.arbitrum.io/tx-lifecycle">transaction lifecycle</a>:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Soft finality</strong>: Once the Sequencer receives and processes a transaction, it
    emits a receipt through the Sequencer's feed. At this point, if the Sequencer is trusted, the
    transaction will not undergo reordering, and after processing, the chain state can be
    determined.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Hard finality</strong>: At this stage, assuming there's at least one well-behaved active
    Arbitrum validator, the client can treat their transaction's finality as equivalent to that of
    an ordinary Ethereum transaction.
  </li>
</ul>

### Where can I find stats for Arbitrum?

<p>
  Although we currently don't maintain any stats dashboard for Arbitrum, you can find many{' '}
  <a href="https://dune.com/browse/dashboards?q=arbitrum">community created dashboards</a> in Dune.
</p>

<p>

</p>

### Will transactions with a higher "gas price bid" be confirmed first?

<p>
  There is no notion of a mempool on Arbitrum; transactions are processed on a first-come,
  first-served basis by the Sequencer. Thus, the gas price bid parameter does not affect the order
  in which transactions get processed.
</p>

<p>

</p>

### Where can I find a list of the current validators of the Arbitrum chains?

<p>
  Validation on both Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova is currently allow-listed to a committee of
  public entities. You can see the list of validators 
  <strong>
    <a href="https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/state-of-progressive-decentralization#allowlisted-validators">
      here
    </a>
  </strong>. Governance currently has the power to change this status.
</p>

<p>

</p>

### Where can I find the current Data Availability Committee members?

<p>
  The Arbitrum Nova chain has a 7-party DAC, whose members can be seen 
  <strong>
    <a href="https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/state-of-progressive-decentralization#data-availability-committee-members">
      here
    </a>
  </strong>. Governance has the ability to remove or add members to the committee.
</p>

<p>

</p>

### Can I withdraw my funds from Arbitrum back to Ethereum without going through the Sequencer? What about funds that are in a contract?

<p>
  Yes, it is possible to send a message from Ethereum to be executed on Arbitrum permissionlessly,
  while bypassing the Sequencer. You can achieve this by using the <code>DelayedInbox</code>{' '}
  contract and forcing the inclusion of the message after a certain amount of time has passed
  (currently ~24 hours). For more information about this behavior, refer to{' '}
  <a href="https://docs.arbitrum.io/sequencer#unhappyuncommon-case-sequencer-isnt-doing-its-job">
    How Arbitrum Works
  </a>
  .
</p>

<p>
  Keep in mind that you can execute any message in this way, be it a withdrawal of funds back to
  Ethereum or a call to a contract.
</p>

<p>
  You can also find an example of force-inclusion in{' '}
  <a href="https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-tutorials/tree/master/packages/delayedInbox-l2msg">
    this tutorial
  </a>
  .
</p>

### Are there any plans to reduce the time a transaction needs to wait before being able to be force-included from Ethereum into the Arbitrum chain, bypassing the sequencer? (Currently 24 hours)

<p>
  The mechanism that allows force-including transactions from Ethereum (bypassing the sequencer) is
  intended to be used in very rare cases, especially when it is expected that the sequencer will not
  be operational again, so that users have a way of interacting with Arbitrum in a trustless way.
</p>

<p>
  When using this mechanism, if the sequencer is down for longer than the time window for
  force-including transactions from Ethereum, the moment it is online again, it can lead to a
  reorganization of blocks in Arbitrum (it would have received transactions timestamped before the
  force-included one).
</p>

<p>
  24 hours was chosen because it provides a comfortable period of time for the team running the
  sequencer infrastructure to fix any bugs that may cause the sequencer to not work. While there
  aren't any active initiatives to lower that time, the decision ultimately falls in the hands of
  the Arbitrum DAO, who has discussed the topic in their governance forum (
  <a href="https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-decrease-censorship-delay-from-24-hours-to-4-hours/13047">
    see here for more information
  </a>
  ).
</p>

<p>
  In any case, we could also analyze why would someone use this mechanism having an honest and
  functional sequencer. For instance, if the reason is a distrust of the sequencer, a centralised
  agent as of now, one potential solution could be to{' '}
  <a href="https://medium.com/@espressosys/offchain-labs-partnership-improving-transaction-ordering-for-arbitrum-technology-chains-beyond-de2b6018acb2">
    decentralize the sequencer
  </a>{' '}
  instead of reducing the force-inclusion delay time.
</p>

<p>

</p>

### What is the difference between an child chain block and an assertion?

<p>
  A child chain block is very similar to the concept of an parent chain block. These blocks are
  generated by validator nodes of Arbitrum by executing the state transition function on sequenced
  transactions. The structure of a child chain block is similar to that of an Ethereum block, with a
  few differences that you can{' '}
  <a href="https://docs.arbitrum.io/for-devs/concepts/differences-between-arbitrum-ethereum/rpc-methods#blocks">
    see here
  </a>
  .
</p>

<p>
  On the other hand, an assertion is a distinctive block that is transmitted back to the parent
  chain to serve as a fingerprint of the most recent state of the Arbitrum chain. It comprises an
  assertion of the present state root of the Arbitrum chain and other essential information
  pertaining to withdrawals and challenges. The structure of assertions can be viewed{' '}
  <a href="https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/2436da3fbf339ce72b02f761254aff5b86efafac/contracts/src/rollup/Node.sol#L7">
    here
  </a>
  .
</p>

<p>
  These assertions are also generated by validators, but they are appended to the parent chain.
  Other validators can{' '}
  <a href="https://docs.arbitrum.io/inside-arbitrum-nitro/#resolving-disputes-using-interactive-fraud-proofs">
    challenge them
  </a>{' '}
  during a specific time frame of approximately one week if they discover that the current state
  hash of the chain varies from the one that was initially claimed. Once the challenge period
  elapses, the assertion is confirmed on the parent chain.
</p>

<p>

</p>

### Why do Arbitrum chains enforce a speed limit? Isn't it better that the speed grows without limits?

<p>
  The transaction lifecycle sets a limit that we have to take into account: validators have to
  execute each transaction, get the status of the chain, and post an assertion to Ethereum every
  certain amount of time. If the speed of the chain increases too much, there is a risk that
  validators won't have enough computation power to process all transactions in a timely manner, and
  will fall behind on validating them, which would cause the chain to delay confirmations of its
  state.
</p>

<p>

</p>
