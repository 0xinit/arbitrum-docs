<p>
A <a href="/intro/glossary#validator">Validator</a> who deposits a stake (in Ether on <a href="/intro/glossary#arbitrum-one">Arbitrum One</a> and <a href="/intro/glossary#arbitrum-nova">Arbitrum Nova</a> ) to vouch for a particular <a href="/intro/glossary#assertion">Assertion</a> in an Arbitrum Chain. A validator who stakes on a false assertion can expect to lose their stake. An honest staker can recover their stake once the assertion they are staked on has been confirmed.
