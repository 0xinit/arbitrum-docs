A means by which a user can bypass an Arbitrum chain's <a href="/intro/glossary#challenge-period">Challenge Period</a> when withdrawing fungible assets (or more generally, executing some "fungible" L2 to L1 operation); for trustless fast exits, a liquidity provider facilitates an atomic swap of the asset on L2 directly to L1.
