<p>
A situation in which transactions on a chain that were at some point considered accepted then get rejected. In the context of an Arbitrum chain, once transactions are posted in the chain's <a href="/intro/glossary#fast-inbox">Fast Inbox</a>, the only way the chain can experience a reorg is if its <a href="/intro/glossary#underlying-chain">Underlying Chain</a> itself reorgs. Of note, <a href="/intro/glossary#fraud-proof">Fraud proof</a>s do not cause reorgs.
