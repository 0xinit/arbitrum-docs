<p>
When two <a href="/intro/glossary#staker">Staker</a>s disagree about the correct verdict on an <a href="/intro/glossary#assertion">Assertion</a>, those stakers can be put in a challenge. The challenge is refereed by the contracts on the underlying chain. Eventually one staker wins the challenge. The protocol guarantees that an honest  party will always win a challenge; the loser forfeits their stake.
