A semi-trusted promise from the <a href="/intro/glossary#sequencer">Sequencer</a>  to post a user's transaction in the near future; soft-confirmations happen prior to posting on the <a href="/intro/glossary#parent-chain">Parent chain</a>, and thus can be given near-instantaneously (i.e., faster than the parent chain's block times)
