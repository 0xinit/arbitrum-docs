<p>
Off chain software that receives bids from <a href="/intro/glossary#timeboost">Timeboost</a>  participants, processes and validates bids, and then posts the top valid bid (or top two valid bids in the case of a tie) to the <a href="/intro/glossary#auction-contract">Auction Contract</a>  to resolve the on-going Timeboost auction. The autonomous auctioneer, for a given chain, is provisioned & deployed by an entity designated by the chain's owner.
