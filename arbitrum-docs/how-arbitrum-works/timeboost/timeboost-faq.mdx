Below are a number of common and frequently asked questions about Timeboost. This list of questions is in no particular order and will be updated periodically as new questions arise.

### 1. As a typical user, will I notice any difference in my experience?

The only difference users should experience is a small delay when submitting their transactions. The default configuration for this delay is 200ms and can be changed by the DAO.

This delay is to give the express lane controller an advantage so they are able to include transactions slightly quicker than others. Importantly, user transactions will still remain private until after they are sequenced, meaning that the express lane controller cannot frontrun or sandwich other users.

### 2. How can I participate in Timeboost directly?

Interested parties can participate in the Timeboost auctions by depositing funds in the auction contract and sending bids to the autonomous auctioneer. Feel free to refer to [this guide](../timeboost/how-to-use-timeboost.mdx) for more information.

The Timeboost auction is open to everyone; however, since auctions require a non-zero bid to win, we believe that only parties who can make a return from capturing arbitrage opportunities, backrunning opportunities, or from reselling the express lane rights will benefit from participating.

The Timeboost protocol works behind the scenes with minimal impact on normal users while generating revenue for the Arbitrum DAO and opening up an additional revenue stream for sophisticated searchers.

### 3. What is the goal of Timeboost?

The goal of Timeboost is to give chain owners a way to capture available MEV on their chain and reduce spam from FCFS arbitrage _all while_ preserving best-in-class user experience with both fast block times and protecting users from harmful MEV (e.g. frontrunning/sandwich attacks).

Any proposed change, technical or otherwise, to Arbitrum One and Nova should prioritize ensuring the best user experience and optimal functioning of the chain ahead of other priorities. Timeboost explicitly embodies this principle in 3 ways:

1. Arbitrum One and Nova block times will continue to be industry leading at 250ms even after Timeboost. What will change with Timeboost is that some transactions, specifically those not in the express lane, will be delayed to the next block. If there is an Express Lane controller for a given round, users will wait, at most, 450ms for their transactions to be sequenced (200ms nominal delay, plus 250ms block time). Furthermore, the time for a user’s transaction to be sequenced will fall back to 250ms (or whatever the blocktime is for other Arbitrum chains) if there is no express lane controller. All of these values for Arbitrum One and Nova, both the block time and the nominal delay for non-express lane transactions, are controlled by governance and are far shorter than the blocktimes seen on other L2 and even rival alternative L1s.
2. Timeboost is purely supplemental to Arbitrum chains. The chain will fall back to the current FCFS ordering policy if (1) Timeboost is turned “off” (trivial, controlled by governance) or (2) if there is no express lane controller for the given round.
3. With Timeboost, the mempool for transactions will continue to be private, which means users will continue to be protected from harmful MEV like front-running and sandwich attacks. This ensures a great user experience.

### 4. Does it work with Orbit chains?

Timeboost can be adopted by Orbit chains, and Orbit chain owners can also choose to use any ERC20 token for making bids. For example, a chain could choose to accept its own token for the auction.

### 5. Does Timeboost mean that searchers are expected to bid continuously in advance, expecting opportunities to happen 1 minute later, rather than “in real time” opportunities (I see something → I submit an arbitrage tx with priority)?

Before answering this question, it is worth clarifying that the participant will likely attempt to predict the amount of MEV generated between 15s and 1min 15s in the future - not 1 minute later. This is because the auction is closed and resolved at a maximum of 15 seconds before the start of the next round (in the current proposal).

Willing participants are expected to bid continuously for the right to use the express lane in advance so that they (the participant) can profit from both: (1) MEV opportunities they predict between 15s and 1min 15s in the future _and_ (2) MEV opportunities in real time during the period of time that the participant is in control of the express lane that they didn’t otherwise predict in advance (proposed duration: 1 minute). If the participant does not win control of the express lane, opportunities that they see in real time can still be exploited, but with a 200ms delay like all other txns (since only the express lane controller’s transactions get sequenced with no delay)

### 6. What are the different variations of Timeboost?

Timeboost is implemented via changes to the sequencer to add an express lane and the deployment of an autonomous auctioneer service to facilitate the auction (sealed-bid, second-price) for temporary rights to control said express lane.

There are other variations of Timeboost that are possible, but not yet fully designed or developed yet. These are setups where the sequencer is decentralized but uses a trusted single autonomous auctioneer service, or another setup where the sequencer is decentralized and the autonomous auctioneer is made to be trustless (via potentially through decentralization or by other means).

Timeboost is currently implemented with a centralized sequencer and a single, trusted autonomous auctioneer, which we can define as “Centralized Timeboost”. This decision by the ArbitrumDAO to adopt Centralized Timeboost now, without those other variations being ready for production, was made to deliver a form of Timeboost earlier to quickly gather and iterate on feedback received from the market.

### 7. Will Timeboost work with future decentralized Arbitrum sequencers?

Yes. Timeboost is compatible with both the current centralized sequencer and a future design that allows Arbitrum chains to benefit from a decentralized group of sequencers. The current approach allowed us to deliver Timeboost sooner, rather than waiting until the decentralized sequencer design and implementation are complete.

### 8. Will there be plans for a clean user interface that allows users to understand the logic of how their transactions are sorted, as well as an optional setting to adjust the sensitivity to the time factor?

For the first point about a clearer user interface: users can subscribe to the sequencer feed to view, in live time, the final order of transactions. We believe using the sequencer feed is a sufficient solution for helping users understand the logic behind how their transactions are sorted. Additional documentation and diagrams will be made available to help illustrate this workflow.

To the second point: the ArbitrumDAO can, via governance, change the amount of time that non-express lane transactions are delayed. This parameter, defined as the NonExpressDelayMsec, is denominated in miliseconds and is proposed to be 200ms to start.

### 9. How will Timeboost affect block time finality on Arbitrum chains? Does this mean that an Arbitrum chain’s new block time will be 450ms

Recall that Arbitrum chains have two types of finality: (1) a trusted or soft confirmation and (2) Ethereum-equivalent finality. A trusted or soft confirmation for a user’s transaction relies on the user trusting the sequencer and the near-instant transaction receipt issued by the sequencer, which takes approximately 250ms. For (2), the user can use the Ethereum-equivalent finality heuristic once their L2 transaction has been finalized on L1, as part of a batch of transactions posted to Ethereum, which can take 2 epochs or roughly 13 minutes in today’s Proof-of-Stake Ethereum. Read more about these two types of finality [here](https://docs.arbitrum.io/how-arbitrum-works/tx-lifecycle).

With Timeboost, both finality timelines _for non-express lane transactions_ (250ms for soft finality and ~13minutes for Ethereum-equivalent finality) will be extended by the default 200ms delay proposed in Timeboost, which will be roughly ~450ms and ~13 minutes & 0.2 seconds for soft finality and Ethereum-equivalent finality, respectively. For express lane transactions, there will be no impact on transaction finality, meaning that finality will remain at 250ms and ~13minutes for soft finality and Etheruem-equivalent finality, respectively.'

### 10. How do I change my bid or cancel my bid after I have submitted a bid?

The autonomous auctioneer will consider only an addresses’ most recent bid.

This means that if you have placed a bid and wish to change it, you may re-submit a bid to “update it”. If you wish to cancel a bid, simply place a new bid that is significantly lower than your first bid, or just bid below the minimum reserve price. Remember that there is a maximum 5 bids per round per address to mitigate DDoS risks.

### 11. Does Timeboost create new types of MEV extraction vectors?

Timeboost does not create new types of Maximum Extractable Value (MEV). Instead, it introduces slight adjustments to when and how existing forms of MEV operate. Timeboost is designed to strike a balance between capturing MEV value for the chain without introducing additional externalities.

For example, Timeboost does not enable transaction reordering in a way that facilitates sandwich attacks. The protocol does allow users to try to get their transactions processed earlier by gaining control of the express lane, but it doesn’t allow them to manipulate the order in which trades occur relative to others in the same block. This means the fast lane controller [at any given time] cannot be certain of how their transactions are ordered relative to others’ transactions.

### 12. Does Timeboost give the auction winner an unfair advantage or power around transaction ordering?

Winning a Timeboost auction gives you a time advantage — specifically, a proposed 200ms “head start” — but it does not ensure your transaction will always be the first in every block. The perceived value of the express lane is pre-determined by its holder and how much they chose to bid to win control of it: it’s a use it or lose it privilege. Let’s be clear on what Timeboost does not do:

- It does not give anyone the right to reorder transactions. It does not let you see others’ transactions before they are sequenced (because the mempool will remain private).
- It does not ensure your transaction will always be the first in every block.
- It does not mean your tx will have absolutely zero total time delay. Winning the bid means you won’t experience the 200ms artificial delay others face, but natural delays — such as processing time or network distance — still apply.

### 13. Is it expected for powerful, centralized entities to monopolize the Timeboost express lane? Could this lead to harmful outcomes?

Timeboost is designed as an auction-based system that encourages open competition. Although the idea of a monopoly can be scary, the auction process is still competitive. If one player dominates, they will be required to continuously outbid other users, which prevents complete static control. Additionally, the express lane only gives a 200ms time advantage. The system is designed to incentivize rational actors to participate when they believe there is an advantage to controlling the express lane and only bid up to the value they are willing to pay for that advantage (since it is a sealed-bid auction).

Finally, we want to stress that Timeboost is entirely optional, meaning that Arbitrum chains can still function normally without it. Should Timeboost need to be disabled, the network would smoothly revert to FCFS transaction ordering, maintaining its current security and efficiency. Every chain can make its own decision about whether to enable Timeboost–your chain, your rules.

### 14. Is there a way to track the time (ms, etc) it takes for a transaction to be sent and received by the sequencer?

Yes! Simply measure the time between when you send your transaction and when you see it in the sequencer feed. Here, I am assuming that “accepted” refers to the point at which the sequencer has seen your transaction and processed it into a block. This number is not uniformly consistent because different teams will have access to different hardware and set ups that may change how quickly they can send messages over the public internet to the sequencer and also how quickly they can read the sequencer’s feed for state updates and transaction receipts.

### 15. Does gas have any effect on the transaction ordering in the sequencer?

Yes because if your transaction did not provide enough gas, it might be rejected outright. The impact on transaction ordering will be that your transaction could potentially be excluded in an upcoming block because there wasn’t enough gas specified to satisfy the network’s requirements for processing your transaction (L2 execution + L1 data posting costs).

### 16. Does Arbitrum support non-JSON formats for submitting transactions?

No

### 17. How does the sequencer handle raw transaction requests that contain incorrect data, like inconsistent nonce? For example, multiple transactions by same wallet with same nonce are submitted to sequencer. Would there be any penalty for that wallet/ip address?

You should expect to get a nonce error. This behavior will work today, but this is considered abuse and we provide no guarantees on how this behavior will be treated in the future.

### 18. Does sequencer have any rate limit? If it has, what is the limit and Is it per IP address or per wallet?

Yes but these limits are not published but we don’t expect anyone to hit it. The limits are per IP address.

### 19. Is it recommended to send requests to the sequencers' IP addresses directly instead of the sequencer domain, if we want lowest latency?

No, it is not recommended.

### 20. Is there a more efficient way to track if our transaction has been accepted/rejected by sequencer, then listening to smart contract events or transaction counts?

Yes. We recommend teams to watch for and check transaction receipts to get formal confirmation that their transaction made it into a block.

### 21. For Timeboost, is there any limit of how many transactions can be boosted by the winner in a round?

There is no transaction limit, but there is a block-based limit: if your timeboosted transactions cannot be sequenced in 5 Arbitrum blocks (1250ms) from the time that they were received by the sequencer, then it will be dropped. The 200ms Timeboost time advantage only lasts for 1000ms anyways and so we believe this to be a safe limit that people will not hit. Note that the block gas limit may be a reason for why your transaction could not be included in an Arbitrum block. More details on this limit can be found in this section of our docs [here](../timeboost/troubleshoot-timeboost.mdx)

### 22. If a transaction is Timeboosted, and we assume it arrived in the current block creation period that has other non-express lane transactions, then would that Timeboosted transaction be enqueued in front of those other non-express lane transactions that already arrived but not yet included?

It depends on the arrival timestamp of all the transactions. Non-timeboosted transactions will receive a 200ms delay before being sequenced while timeboosted transactions will receive zero delay before being sequenced. In your scenario, if the non-timeboosted transactions had arrived 200ms earlier than the timeboosted transaction, then they would be sequenced alongside the timeboosted transaction based on their arrival timestamps. In this case for that block, some non-timeboosted transactions may indeed be ahead of timeboosted transactions due to the timestamps. I strongly recommend reading this [document that explains how Timeboost works](../timeboost/gentle-introduction.mdx).

### 23. Other than Timeboost, is there any other mechanism/factor that can affect transaction priority/latency?

There are many factors, including how your infrastructure setup is built and where you are sending transactions from. Latency is something that the top teams will optimize for and so I would recommend spending lots of time focusing on this to ensure you’re set up to maximally benefit from Timeboost. I will say, though, that the 200ms time advantage you receive from using Timeboost is likely more than enough to exploit the arbitrage opportunities on-chain (ahead of competitors who are not using Timeboost)

### 24. Any recommendations for submitting transactions to Arbitrum in lower latency, on top of Timeboost?

Yeah! We recommend:

- Doing adequate testing of your infrastructure to optimize for the geographical latency considerations,
  A solid set up for bid submission if using Timeboost,
- Running your own transaction pre-checker, Arbitrum full node, and a client to subscribe to the sequencer feed for the fastest on-chain updates, the ability to send transactions fast, and robust nonce management, and
- Build a good observability and monitoring stack to watch and take-action on events from the auction and also to review & process transaction receipts quickly to confirm behavior
