# The Sequencer and Censorship Resistance

The Sequencer is a specially designated Arbitrum full node which, under normal conditions, is responsible for submitting users’ transactions onto L1. In principle, a chain’s Sequencer can take different forms; as [Arbitrum One currently stands](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/state-of-progressive-decentralization), the Sequencer is a single, centralized entity; eventually, sequencing affordances could be given to a distributed committee of sequencers which come to consensus on ordering. However, regardless of its form, the Sequencer has a fundamental limitation that doesn’t apply to any other part of the system: it must operate under its own security assumptions; i.e., it can’t, in principle, derive security directly from layer 1. This brings up the question of how Arbitrum Rollup maintains its claim to censorship resistance when-and-if the Sequencer misbehaves.

Here we will describe the mechanics of how the Sequencer typically operates, and how any user can bypass the Sequencer entirely to submit any Arbitrum transaction (including one that, say, initiates an L2 to L1 message to withdraw funds) directly from layer 1. Thus mechanism thereby preserves censorship resistance even if the Sequencer is being completely unresponsive or even malicious.




## The Core Inbox

When we talk about “submitting a transaction into an Arbitrum chain,” we’re talking about getting it included into the chain’s core Inbox, represented by the `sequencerInboxAccs` byte array in `Bridge`. Once transactions are included in the core Inbox, their ordering is fixed, execution is fully deterministic, and we can trustlessly treat the resultant state as having L1-level finality (see “Transaction Lifecycle”). The Sequencer’s role (or lack thereof) concerns strictly what happens prior; i.e., how a transaction makes its way into the core Inbox. We’ll break down the possible routes a transaction can take into two scenarios: a well-behaved Sequencer, and a faulty Sequencer.

## Bridging

We have already covered how users interact with L2 contracts--they submit transactions by putting messages into the chain’s inbox, or having a full node Sequencer or aggregator do so on their behalf. Let’s talk about how contracts interact between L1 and L2--how an L1 contract calls an L2 contract, and vice versa.

The L1 and L2 chains run asynchronously from each other, so it is not possible to make a cross-chain call that produces a result within the same transaction as the caller. Instead, cross-chain calls must be asynchronous, meaning that the caller submits the call at some point in time, and the call runs later. As a consequence, a cross-chain contract-to-contract call can never produce a result that is available to the calling contract (except for acknowledgement that the call was successfully submitted for later execution).

### L1 contracts can submit L2 transactions

An L1 contract can submit an L2 transaction, just like a user would, by calling the Nitro chain's inbox contract on Ethereum. This L2 transaction will run later, producing results that will not be available to the L1 caller. The transaction will execute at L2, but the L1 caller won’t be able to see any results from the L2 transaction.

The advantage of this method is that it is simple and has relatively low latency. The disadvantage, compared to the other method we’ll describe soon, is that the L2 transaction might revert if the L1 caller doesn’t get the L2 gas price and max gas amount right. Because the L1 caller can’t see the result of its L2 transaction, it can’t be absolutely sure that its L2 transaction will succeed.

This would introduce a serious a problem for certain types of L1 to L2 interactions. Consider a transaction that includes depositing a token on L1 to be made available at some address on L2. If the L1 side succeeds, but the L2 side reverts, you've just sent some tokens to the L1 inbox contract that are unrecoverable on either L2 or L1. Not good.

### L1 to L2 ticket-based transactions

Fortunately, we have another method for L1 to L2 calls, which is more robust against gas-related failures, that uses a ticket-based system. The idea is that an L1 contract can submit a “retryable” transaction. The Nitro chain will try to run that transaction. If the transaction succeeds, nothing else needs to happen. But if the transaction fails, Nitro will create a “ticketID” that identifies that failed transaction. Later, anyone can call a special pre-compiled contract at L2, providing the ticketID, to try redeeming the ticket and re-executing the transaction.

When saving a transaction for retry, Nitro records the sender’s address, destination address, callvalue, and calldata. All of this is saved, and the callvalue is deducted from the sender’s account and (logically) attached to the saved transaction.

If the redemption succeeds, the transaction is done, a receipt is issued for it, and the ticketID is canceled and can’t be used again. If the redemption fails, for example because the packaged transaction fails, the redemption reports failure and the ticketID remains available for redemption.

Normally the original submitter will try to cause their transaction to succeed immediately, so it never needs to be recorded or retried. As an example, our "token deposit" use case above should, in the happy, common case, still only require a single signature from the user. If this initial execution fails, the ticketID will still exist as a backstop which others can redeem later.

Submitting a transaction in this way carries a price in ETH which the submitter must pay, which varies based on the calldata size of the transaction. Once submitted, the ticket is valid for about a week. If the ticket has not been redeemed in that period, it is deleted.

When the ticket is redeemed, the pre-packaged transaction runs with sender and origin equal to the original submitter, and with the destination, callvalue, and calldata the submitter provided at the time of submission.

This mechanism is a bit more cumbersome than ordinary L1 to L2 transactions, but it has the advantage that the submission cost is predictable and the ticket will always be available for redemption if the submission cost is paid. As long as there is some user who is willing to redeem the ticket, the L2 transaction will eventually be able to execute and will not be silently dropped.

### L2 to L1 ticket-based calls

Calls from L2 to L1 operate in a similar way, with a ticket-based system. An L2 contract can call a method of the precompiled ArbSys contract, to send a transaction to L1. When the execution of the L2 transaction containing the submission is confirmed at L1 (some days later), a ticket is created in the L1 outbox contract. That ticket can be triggered by anyone who calls a certain L1 outbox method and submits the ticketID. The ticket is only marked as redeemed if the L1 transaction does not revert.

These L2-to-L1 tickets have unlimited lifetime, until they’re successfully redeemed. No rent is required, as the tickets (actually a Merkle hash of the tickets) are recorded in Ethereum storage, which does not require rent. (The cost of allocating storage for the ticket Merkle roots is covered by L2 transaction fees.)

## Retryable Tickets

Retryable tickets are Arbitrum's canonical method for creating L1 to L2 messages, i.e., L1 transactions that initiate a message to be executed on L2. A retryable can be submitted for a fixed cost (dependent only on its calldata size) paid at L1; its _submission_ on L1 is separable / asynchronous with its _execution_ on L2. Retryables provide atomicity between the cross chain operations; if the L1 transaction to request submission succeeds (i.e. does not revert) then the execution of the Retryable on L2 has a strong guarantee to ultimately succeed as well.

## Retryable Tickets Lifecycle

Here we walk through the different stages of the lifecycle of a retryable ticket; (1) submission, (2) auto-redemption, and (3) manual redemption.

### Submission

1. Creating a retryable ticket is initiated with a call (direct or internal) to the `createRetryableTicket` function of the [`inbox` contract][inbox_link]. A ticket is guaranteed to be created if this call succeeds. Here, we describe parameters that need to be carefully set. Note that, this function forces the sender to provide a _reasonable_ amount of funds (at least enough to submitting, and _attempting_ to executing the ticket), but that doesn't guarantee a successful auto-redemption.

| Parameter                                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

2. Sender's deposit must be enough to make the L1 submission succeed and for the L2 execution to be _attempted_. If provided correctly, a new ticket with a unique `TicketID` is created and added to retryable buffer. Also, funds (`submissionCost` + `l2CallValue`) are deducted from the sender and placed into the escrow for later use in redeeming the ticket.

3. Ticket creation causes the [`ArbRetryableTx`](/build-decentralized-apps/precompiles/02-reference.mdx#arbretryabletx) precompile to emit a `TicketCreated` event containing the `TicketID` on L2.

### Automatic Redemption

4. It is very important to note that the submission of a ticket on L1 is separable / asynchronous from its execution on L2, i.e., a successful L1 ticket creation does not guarantee a successful redemption. Once the ticket is successfully created, the two following conditions are checked: (1) if the user's L2 balance is greater than (or equal to) `maxFeePerGas * gasLimit` **and** (2) if the `maxFeePerGas` (provided by the user in the ticket submission process) is greater than (or equal to) the `l2Basefee`. If these conditions are both met, ticket's submission is followed by an attempt to execute it on L2 (i.e., an **auto-redeem** using the supplied gas, as if the `redeem` method of the [ArbRetryableTx](/build-decentralized-apps/precompiles/02-reference.mdx#arbretryabletx) precompile had been called). Depending on how much gas the sender has provided in step 1, ticket's redemption can either (1) immediately succeed or (2) fail. We explain both situations here:

- If the ticket is successfully auto-redeemed, it will execute with the sender, destination, callvalue, and calldata of the original submission. The submission fee is refunded to the user on L2 (`excessFeeRefundAddress`). Note that to ensure successful auto-redeem of the ticket, one could use the Arbitrum SDK which provides a [convenience function](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-sdk/blob/4cedb1fcf1c7302a4c3d0f8e75fb33d82bc8338d/src/lib/message/L1ToL2MessageGasEstimator.ts#L215) that returns the desired gas parameters when sending L1-L2 messages.

- If a redeem is not done at submission or the submission's initial redeem fails (for example, because the L2 gas price has increased unexpectedly), the submission fee is collected on L2 to cover the resources required to temporarily keep the ticket in memory for a fixed period (one week), and only in this case, a manual redemption of the ticket is required (see next section).

### Manual Redemption

5. At this point, _anyone_ can attempt to manually redeem the ticket again by calling [ArbRetryableTx](/build-decentralized-apps/precompiles/02-reference.mdx#arbretryabletx)'s `redeem` precompile method, which donates the call's gas to the next attempt. Note that the amount of gas is NOT limited by the original gasLimit set during the ticket creation. ArbOS will [enqueue the redeem][enqueue_link], which is its own special `ArbitrumRetryTx` type, to its list of redeems that ArbOS [guarantees to exhaust][exhaust_link] before moving on to the next non-redeem transaction in the block its forming. In this manner redeems are scheduled to happen as soon as possible, and will always be in the same block as the tx that scheduled it. Note that the redeem attempt's gas comes from the call to redeem, so there's no chance the block's gas limit is reached before execution.

6. If the fixed period (one week) elapses without a successful redeem, the ticket **expires** and will be [automatically **discarded**][discard_link], unless some party has paid a fee to [**keep the ticket alive**][renew_link] for another full period. A ticket can live indefinitely as long as it is renewed each time before it expires.

:::caution Avoid Losing Funds!

If a ticket expires after 7 days without being redeemed or re-scheduled to a future date, any message and value (other than the escrowed `callvalue`) it carries could be lost without possibility of being recovered.

:::

On success, the `To` address receives the escrowed callvalue, and any unused gas is returned to ArbOS's gas pools. On failure, the callvalue is returned to the escrow for the future redeem attempt. In either case, the network fee was paid during the scheduling tx, so no fees are charged and no refunds are made.

Note that during redemption of a ticket, attempts to cancel the same ticket, or to schedule another redeem of the same ticket, will revert. In this manner retryable tickets are not self-modifying.

If a ticket with a callvalue is eventually discarded (cancelled or expired), having never successfully run, the escrowed callvalue will be paid out to a `callValueRefundAddress` account that was specified in the initial submission (step 1).

:::note Important Notes:

If a redeem is not done at submission or the submission's initial redeem fails, anyone can attempt to redeem the retryable again by calling [`ArbRetryableTx`](/build-decentralized-apps/precompiles/02-reference.mdx#arbretryabletx)'s `redeem` precompile method, which donates the call's gas to the next attempt. ArbOS will [enqueue the redeem][enqueue_link], which is its own special `ArbitrumRetryTx` type, to its list of redeems that ArbOS [guarantees to exhaust][exhaust_link] before moving on to the next non-redeem transaction in the block its forming. In this manner redeems are scheduled to happen as soon as possible, and will always be in the same block as the transaction that scheduled it. Note that the redeem attempt's gas comes from the call to `redeem`, so there's no chance the block's gas limit is reached before execution.

- One can redeem live tickets using the [Arbitrum Retryables Transaction Panel][retryable_dashboard_link]
- The calldata of a ticket is saved on L2 until it is redeemed or expired
- Redeeming cost of a ticket will not increase over time, it only depends on the current gas price and gas required for execution

### Receipts

In the lifecycle of a retryable ticket, two types of L2 transaction receipts will be emitted:

- **Ticket Creation Receipt**: This receipt indicates that a ticket was successfully created; any successful L1 call to the `Inbox`'s `createRetryableTicket` method is guaranteed to create a ticket. The ticket creation receipt includes a `TicketCreated` event (from `ArbRetryableTx`), which includes a `ticketId` field. This `ticketId` is computable via RLP encoding and hashing the transaction; see [calculateSubmitRetryableId](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-sdk/blob/6cc143a3bb019dc4c39c8bcc4aeac9f1a48acb01/src/lib/message/L1ToL2Message.ts#L109).
- **Redeem Attempt**: A redeem attempt receipt represents the result of an attempted L2 execution of a ticket, i.e, success / failure of that specific redeem attempt. It includes a `RedeemScheduled` event from `ArbRetryableTx`, with a `ticketId` field. At most, one successful redeem attempt can ever exist for a given ticket; if, e.g., the auto-redeem upon initial creation succeeds, only the receipt from the auto-redeem will ever get emitted for that ticket. If the auto-redeem fails (or was never attempted — i.e., the provided L2 gas limit \* L2 gas price = 0), each initial attempt will emit a redeem attempt receipt until one succeeds.

### Alternative "unsafe" Retryable Ticket Creation

The `Inbox.createRetryableTicket` convenience method includes sanity checks to help minimize the risk of user error: the method will ensure that enough funds are provided directly from L1 to cover the current cost of ticket creation. It also will convert the provided `callValueRefundAddress` and `excessFeeRefundAddress` to their address alias (see below) if either is a contract (determined by if the address has code during the call), providing a path for the L1 contract to recover funds. A power-user may bypass these sanity-check measures via the `Inbox`'s `unsafeCreateRetryableTicket` method; as the method's name desperately attempts to warn you, it should only be accessed by a user who truly knows what they're doing.

## Eth deposits

A special message type exists for simple Eth deposits; i.e., sending Eth from L1 to L2. Eth can be deposited via a call to the `Inbox`'s `depositEth` method. If the L1 caller is EOA, the Eth will be deposited to the same EOA address on L2; the L1 caller is a contract, the funds will deposited to the contract's aliased address (see below).

Note that depositing Eth via `depositEth` into a contract on L2 will _not_ trigger the contract's fallback function.

In principle, retryable tickets can alternatively be used to deposit Ether; this could be preferable to the special eth-deposit message type if, e.g., more flexibility for the destination address is needed, or if one wants to trigger the fallback function on the L2 side.

## Transacting via the Delayed Inbox

While retryables and Eth deposits _must_ be submitted through the delayed inbox, in principle, _any_ message can be included this way; this is a necessary recourse to ensure the Arbitrum chain preserves censorship resistance even if the Sequencer misbehaves (see [The Sequencer and Censorship Resistance](/how-arbitrum-works/sequencer.mdx)). However, under ordinary/happy circumstances, the expectation/recommendation is that clients use the delayed inbox only for Retryables and Eth deposits, and transact via the Sequencer for all other messages.

### Address Aliasing

Unsigned messages submitted via the Delayed Inbox get their sender's addressed "aliased": when these messages are executed on L2, the sender's address —i.e., that which is returned by `msg.sender` — will _not_ simply be the L1 address that sent the message; rather it will be the address's "L2 Alias." An address's L2 alias is its value increased by the hex value `0x1111000000000000000000000000000000001111`:

```sol
L2_Alias = L1_Contract_Address + 0x1111000000000000000000000000000000001111
```

<AddressAliasHelper />
:::

The Arbitrum protocol's usage of L2 Aliases for L1-to-L2 messages prevents cross-chain exploits that would otherwise be possible if we simply reused the same L1 addresses as the L2 sender; i.e., tricking an L2 contract that expects a call from a given contract address by sending retryable ticket from the expected contract address on L1.

If for some reason you need to compute the L1 address from an L2 alias on chain, you can use our `AddressAliasHelper` library:

```sol
modifier onlyFromMyL1Contract() override {
    require(AddressAliasHelper.undoL1ToL2Alias(msg.sender) == myL1ContractAddress, "ONLY_COUNTERPART_CONTRACT");
    _;
}
```

### Signed Messages

The delayed inbox can also accept messages that include a signature. In this case, the message will execute with the `msg.sender` address equal to the address that produced the included signature (i.e., _not_ its alias). Intuitively, the signature proves that the sender address is not a contract, and thus is safe from cross-chain exploit concerns described above. Thus, it can safely execute from signer's address, similar to a transaction included in a Sequencer's batch. For these messages, the address of the L1 sender is effectively ignored at L2.

These signed messages submitted through the delayed inbox can be used to execute messages that bypass the Sequencer and require EOA authorization at L2, e.g., force-including an Ether withdrawal (see ["withdraw eth tutorial"](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-tutorials/blob/a1c3f64a5abdd0f0e728cb94d4ecc2700eab7579/packages/delayedInbox-l2msg/scripts/withdrawFunds.js#L61-L65)).

<!-- from crosschain messaging > l2-l1 messaging --> 
Arbitrum's Outbox system allows for arbitrary L2 to L1 contract calls; i.e., messages initiated from L2 which eventually resolve in execution on L1. L2-to-L1 messages (aka "outgoing" messages) bear many things in common with Arbitrum's [L1-to-L2 messages](/how-arbitrum-works/arbos/l1-l2-messaging.mdx) (Retryables), "in reverse" though with a few differences.

### Protocol Flow

Part of the L2 state of an Arbitrum chain — and consequently, part of what's asserted in every RBlock — is a Merkle root of all L2-to-L1 messages in the chain's history. Upon an asserted RBlock being confirmed (typically ~1 week after its asserted), this Merkle root is posted on L1 in the `Outbox` contract. The Outbox contract then lets users execute their messages — validating Merkle proofs of inclusion, and tracking which L2 to L1 messages have already been spent.

### Client Flow

From a client perspective, an L2 to L1 message begins with a call to the L2 [`ArbSys`](/build-decentralized-apps/precompiles/02-reference.mdx#arbsys) precompile contract's `sendTxToL1` method. Once the message is included in an assertion (typically within ~1 hour) and the assertion is confirmed (typically about ~ 1 week), any client can execute the message. To do this, the client first retrieves the proof data via a call to the Arbitrum chain's "virtual"/precompile-esque\*\* `NodeInterface` contract's `constructOutboxProof` method. The data returned can then be used in the `Outbox`'s `executeTransaction` method to perform the L1 execution.

### Protocol Design Details

An important feature in the design of the Outbox system is that calls to `confirmNode` have constant overhead. Requiring that `confirmNode` only update the constant-sized outgoing message root hash, and that users themselves carry out the final step of execution, achieves this goal; i.e., no matter the number of outgoing messages in the root, or the gas cost of executing them on L1, the cost of confirming nodes remains constant; this ensures that the RBlock confirmation processed can't be griefed.

Unlike Retryables, which have an option to provide Ether for automatic L2 execution, outgoing messages can't provide in-protocol automatic L1 execution, for the simple reason that Ethereum itself doesn't offer scheduled execution affordances. However, application-layer contracts that interact with the Outbox could in principle be built to provide somewhat-analogous "execution market" functionality for outsourcing the final L1 execution step.

Another difference between outgoing messages and Retryables is that Retryables have a limited lifetime before which they must be redeemed (or have their lifetime explicitly extended), whereas L2 to L1 messages are stored in L1 state, and thus persist permanently / have no deadline before which they must be executed.  
The week long delay period before outgoing messages can be executed is inherent and fundamental to the nature of Arbitrum Rollup, or any Optimistic Rollup style L2; the moment a transaction is published on-chain, any observer can anticipate its result; however, for Ethereum itself to accept its result, the protocol must give time for Arbitrum validators to detect and prove fault if need-be. For a protocol overview, see [Inside Arbitrum](/how-arbitrum-works/inside-arbitrum-nitro.mdx)

\*\* We refer to `NodeInterface` as a "virtual" contract; its methods are accessible via calls `0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000C8`, but it doesn't really live on chain. It isn't really a precompile, but behaves a lot like a precompile that can't receive calls from other contracts. This is a cute trick that let's us provide Arbitrum-specific data without having to implement a custom RPC.

## Happy/Common Case: Sequencer Is Live and Well-behaved

Here, we start by assuming that the Sequencer is fully operational, and is running with the intent of processing users’ transactions in as safe and timely a manner as possible. The Sequencer can receive a user’s transaction two ways — either directly via an RPC request, or via the underlying L1.

If a user is posting a “standard” Arbitrum transaction (i.e., interacting with an L2 native dapp), the user will submit the signed transaction directly to the Sequencer, much like how a user submits a transaction to an Ethereum node when interacting with L1. Upon receiving it, the Sequencer will execute it and nearly instantaneously deliver the user a receipt. Some short time later — [usually no more than a few minutes](https://arbiscan.io/batches) — the Sequencer will include the user’s transaction in a batch and post it on L1 by calling one of the `SequencerInbox`’s `addSequencerL2Batch` methods. Note that only the Sequencer has the authority to call these methods; this assurance that no other party can include a message directly is, in fact, the very thing that gives the Sequencer the unique ability to provide instant, "soft-confirmation" receipts.
Once posted in a batch, the transactions have L1-level finality.

Alternatively, a user can submit their L2 message to the Sequencer by posting it on the underlying L1. This path is necessary if the user wishes to perform some [L1 operation along with the L2](/how-arbitrum-works/arbos/l1-l2-messaging.mdx) message and to preserve atomicity between the two — the textbook example here being a token deposit via a [bridge](/build-decentralized-apps/token-bridging/01-overview.mdx) (escrow on L1, mint on L2). The user does this by publishing an L1 transaction (i.e., sending a normal transaction to an L1 node) that calls one of the relevant methods on the `Inbox` contract; i.e., `sendUnsignedTransaction`. This adds a message onto what we’ll call “the delayed Inbox”, (represented by the `delayedInboxAccs` in the `Bridge` contract), which is effectively a queue that messages wait in before being moved over to the core `Inbox`. The Sequencer will emit an L2 receipt about ~10 minutes after the transaction has been included in the delayed Inbox (the reason for this delay is to minimize the risk of short term L1 reorgs which could in turn cause an L2 reorg and invalidate the Sequencer’s L2 receipts.) Again, the last step is for the Sequencer to include the L2 message in a batch — when calling the batch submission methods, the Sequencer specifies how many messages in the delayed inbox to include — finalizing the transaction.

In sum — in either happy case, the user first delivers their message to the Sequencer, who in turn ensures that it arrives in the core Inbox.




## Unhappy/Uncommon Case: Sequencer Isn’t Doing Its Job

Now let’s suppose the Sequencer, for whatever reason, is entirely failing to carry out its task of submitting messages. A user can still get their transaction included in two steps:

First, they submit their L2 message via L1 into the delayed Inbox as described above: note that although atomic cross-chain messages are the common case for using the delayed Inbox, it can in principle be used to submit _any_ L2 message.

Once in the delayed Inbox, we obviously can’t rely on the Sequencer to include the transaction in a batch. Instead, we can use `SequencerInbox`’s `forceInclusion` method. Once a message has been in the delayed Inbox for a sufficient amount of time, `forceInclusion` can be called to move it from the delayed Inbox into the core Inbox, at which point it’s finalized. Crucially, any account can call `forceInclusion`.

Currently, on Arbitrum One, this delay time between submission and force inclusion is roughly @arbOneForceIncludePeriodHours@ hours, as specified by `maxTimeVariation.delayBlocks` / `maxTimeVariation.delaySeconds`. A force inclusion from L1 would directly affect the state for any unconfirmed L2 transactions; keeping conservatively high delay value ensures it should only be used under extraordinary circumstances.

On top of the delay itself, the `forceInclusion` path has the downside of uncertainty around transaction ordering; i.e., while waiting for a message's max delay to pass, a malicious Sequencer could, in principle, directly post messages in front of it. However, there’s ultimately nothing the Sequencer can do to stop it from being included in the core Inbox, at which point its ordering is finalized.

While the slow, “unhappy” path isn’t optimal, and should rarely, if ever, be necessary, its availability as an option ensures Arbitrum Rollup always preserves its trustless security model, even if the permissioned parts of the system act faulty.

### How the Sequencer Publishes the Sequence

So how do nodes get the sequence? The Sequencer publishes it in two ways: a real-time feed, and batches posted on L1 Ethereum.

The real-time feed is published by the Sequencer so that anyone who subscribes to the feed receives instant notifications of each transaction as it is sequenced. Nitro nodes can subscribe to the feed directly from the Sequencer, or through a relay that forwards the feed. The feed represents the Sequencer's promise that it will record transactions in a particular order. If the Sequencer is honest and doesn't have a long downtime, this promise will be kept. So anyone who trusts the Sequencer to keep its promises can rely on the feed to get instant information about the transaction sequence--and they can run the sequenced transactions through the state transition function to learn the results of each transaction immediately. This is "soft finality" for transactions; it's "soft" because it depends on the Sequencer keeping its promises.

The Sequencer also publishes its sequence on the L1 Ethereum chain. Periodically--perhaps every few minutes in production--the Sequencer concatenates the next group of transactions in the feed, compresses them for efficiency, and posts the result as calldata on Ethereum. This is the final and official record of the transaction sequence. As soon as this Ethereum transaction has finality on Ethereum, the Layer 2 Nitro transactions it records will have finality. These transactions are final because their position in the sequence has finality, and the outcome of the transactions is deterministic and knowable to any party. This is "hard finality".

The Sequencer's batches are compressed using a general-purpose data compression algorithm called "brotli", on its highest-compression setting.
