In the [Bypassing the Sequencer](/how-arbitrum-works/02-transaction-lifecycle.mdx#bypassing-the-sequencer) section, we introduced an alternative way for users to submit transactions to a child chain by going through the parent chain's delayed inbox contract instead of sending them directly to the Sequencer. This approach is one example of a parent-to-child messaging path. More broadly, parent-to-child chain messaging covers all ways to:

* Submit child chain bound transaction from a parent chain
* Deposit `ETH` or native tokens from a parent chain to a child chain
* Send arbitrary data or instructions from a parent chain to a child chain

We generally categorize these parent-to-child chain messaging methods as follows:
1. **Native token bridging**: Refers to depositing a child chain's native token from the parent chain to the child chain. Depending on the type of Arbitrum chain, this can include:
  * **ETH Bridging**: For Arbitrum chains that use `ETH` as their gas token, users can deposit `ETH` onto a child chain via the delayed inbox.
  * **Custom gas token bridging**: For Arbitrum chains that use a custom gas token, users can deposit that chain's native token to a child chain using the same mechanism.
2. **Transaction via the delayed inbox**: As described in the [Bypassing the Sequencer](/how-arbitrum-works/02-transaction-lifecycle.mdx#bypassing-the-sequencer) section, this method allows users to send transactions through the parent chain. It includes two sub-types of messages:
  * **Unsigned messages**: General arbitrary data or function calls
  * **Signed messages**: Messages that include a signature, enabling certain authenticated actions
3. **Retryable tickets**: are Arbitrum's canonical mechanism for creating parent-to-child messages–transactions initiated on a parent chain that trigger execution on a child chain. This method contains the following functionality:
  * **General retryable messaging**: For sending arbitrary data or calls from a parent-to-child chain.
  * **Customized feature messagin**g (e.g., token bridging): Leveraging retryable tickets (and other messaging constructs) for specialized actions, such as bridging tokens from a parent-to-child chain.

In this section, we will explore each of these categories in detail and explain how they work. The diagram below illustrates the various paths available for parent-to-child chain communication and asset transfers.

## Native token bridging
Arbitrum chains can use `ETH` or other `ERC-20` tokens as their gas fee currency. Arbitrum One and Nova use `ETH` as their native token, while some Orbit chains opt for a custom gas tokne. For more details about chains that use custom gas tokens, refer to the [Custom gas token SDK](/launch-orbit-chain/concepts/custom-gas-token-sdk.mdx).

Whether a chain uses `ETH` or a custom gas token, users can deposit that token from a parent chain (for Arbitrum One, it is Ethereum) to a child chain. Below, we describe how to deposit `ETH` on chains that use `ETH` as the native gas token. The process for depositing custom gas tokens follows the same steps, except it uses the chain's delayed inbox contract. 

### Depositing ETH
A special message type exists for simple `ETH` deposits from parent-to-child chains. You can deposit `ETH` by calling the `Inbox` contract's `depositEth` method, for example:
```javascript
function depositEth(address destAddr) external payable override returns (uint256)
```

:::note

Depositing `ETH` directly via `depositEth` to a contract on a child chain **will not** invoke that contract's fallback function.

:::

#### Using retryable tickets instead
While `depositEth` is often the simplest path, you can also use *retryable tickets* to deposit `ETH`. This may be preferable if you need additional flexibility–for example, specifying an alternative destination address or triggering a fallback function on a child chain.

#### How deposits work
When you call `Inbox.depositEth`, the `ETH` is sent to the bridge contract on the parent chain. This contract then "credits" the deposited amount to the specified address on the child chain. As far as the parent chain is concerned, the deposited `ETH` remains held by Arbitrum's bridge contract on your behalf.

A diagram illustrating this deposit process can be found below:
* **If the parent chain caller is an Externally Owned Account (EOA)**:
  * The deposited `ETH` will appear in the same EOA address on the child chain.
* **If the parent chain caller is a contract**:
  * The `ETH` will be deposited to the contract's aliased address on the child chain. Aliasing is described below:
