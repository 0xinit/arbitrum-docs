In the [Bypassing the Sequencer](/how-arbitrum-works/02-transaction-lifecycle.mdx#bypassing-the-sequencer) section, we introduced an alternative way for users to submit transactions to a child chain by going through the parent chain's delayed inbox contract instead of sending them directly to the Sequencer. This approach is one example of a parent-to-child messaging path. More broadly, parent-to-child chain messaging covers all ways to:

* Submit child chain bound transaction from a parent chain
* Deposit `ETH` or native tokens from a parent chain to a child chain
* Send arbitrary data or instructions from a parent chain to a child chain

We generally categorize these parent-to-child chain messaging methods as follows:
1. **Native token bridging**: Refers to depositing a child chain's native token from the parent chain to the child chain. Depending on the type of Arbitrum chain, this can include:
  * **ETH Bridging**: For Arbitrum chains that use `ETH` as their gas token, users can deposit `ETH` onto a child chain via the delayed inbox.
  * **Custom gas token bridging**: For Arbitrum chains that use a custom gas token, users can deposit that chain's native token to a child chain using the same mechanism.
2. **Transaction via the delayed inbox**: As described in the [Bypassing the Sequencer](/how-arbitrum-works/02-transaction-lifecycle.mdx#bypassing-the-sequencer) section, this method allows users to send transactions through the parent chain. It includes two sub-types of messages:
  * **Unsigned messages**: General arbitrary data or function calls
  * **Signed messages**: Messages that include a signature, enabling certain authenticated actions
3. **Retryable tickets**: are Arbitrum's canonical mechanism for creating parent-to-child messages–transactions initiated on a parent chain that trigger execution on a child chain. This method contains the following functionality:
  * **General retryable messaging**: For sending arbitrary data or calls from a parent-to-child chain.
  * **Customized feature messagin**g (e.g., token bridging): Leveraging retryable tickets (and other messaging constructs) for specialized actions, such as bridging tokens from a parent-to-child chain.

In this section, we will explore each of these categories in detail and explain how they work. The diagram below illustrates the various paths available for parent-to-child chain communication and asset transfers.

## Native token bridging
Arbitrum chains can use `ETH` or other `ERC-20` tokens as their gas fee currency. Arbitrum One and Nova use `ETH` as their native token, while some Orbit chains opt for a custom gas tokne. For more details about chains that use custom gas tokens, refer to the [Custom gas token SDK](/launch-orbit-chain/concepts/custom-gas-token-sdk.mdx).

Whether a chain uses `ETH` or a custom gas token, users can deposit that token from a parent chain (for Arbitrum One, it is Ethereum) to a child chain. Below, we describe how to deposit `ETH` on chains that use `ETH` as the native gas token. The process for depositing custom gas tokens follows the same steps, except it uses the chain's delayed inbox contract. 

### Depositing ETH
A special message type exists for simple `ETH` deposits from parent-to-child chains. You can deposit `ETH` by calling the `Inbox` contract's `depositEth` method, for example:

```javascript
function depositEth(address destAddr) external payable override returns (uint256)
```

:::note

Depositing `ETH` directly via `depositEth` to a contract on a child chain **will not** invoke that contract's fallback function.

:::

#### Using retryable tickets instead
While `depositEth` is often the simplest path, you can also use *retryable tickets* to deposit `ETH`. This may be preferable if you need additional flexibility–for example, specifying an alternative destination address or triggering a fallback function on a child chain.

#### How deposits work
When you call `Inbox.depositEth`, the `ETH` is sent to the bridge contract on the parent chain. This contract then "credits" the deposited amount to the specified address on the child chain. As far as the parent chain is concerned, the deposited `ETH` remains held by Arbitrum's bridge contract on your behalf.

A diagram illustrating this deposit process can be found below:
* **If the parent chain caller is an Externally Owned Account (EOA)**:
  * The deposited `ETH` will appear in the same EOA address on the child chain.
* **If the parent chain caller is a contract**:
  * The `ETH` will be deposited to the contract's aliased address on the child chain. Aliasing is described below:

![400px-img](/assets/aliasing.svg)

### Address aliasing
All unsigned messages submitted through the delayed inbox have their sender addresses "aliased" when executed on the child chain. Instead of returning the parent chain sender's address as `msg.sender`, the child chain sees the "child alias" of that address. Formally, the child alias is calculated as:

```solidity
Child_Alias = Parent_Contract_Address + 0x1111000000000000000000000000000000001111
```

#### Why aliasing?
Address aliasing in Arbitrum is a security measure that prevents cross-chain exploits. Without it, a malicious actor could impersonate a contract on a child chain by simply sending a message from that contract's parent chain address. By introducing an offset, Arbitrum ensures that child chain contracts can distinguish between calls from parent chain contracts and calls from child-chain-native addresses.

#### Computing the original parent chain address
If you need to recover the original parent chain address from an aliased child chain address onchain, you can use Arbitrum's `AddressAliasHelper` library. This allows you to translate between the aliased child address and the original parent address in your contract logic.

```solidity
modifier onlyFromMyL1Contract() override {
    require(AddressAliasHelper.undoL1ToL2Alias(msg.sender) == myL1ContractAddress, "ONLY_COUNTERPART_CONTRACT");
    _;
}
```

## Transacting via the delayed inbox
Arbitrum provides a *delayed inbox* contract on the parent chain that can deliver arbitrary messages to the child chain. This functionality is important for two reasons:
1. **General cross-chain messaging**: Allows parent chain EOAs or parent chain contracts to send messages or transactions to a child chain. This is critical for bridging assets (other than the chain's native token) and performing cross-chain operations.
2. **Censorship resistance**: It ensures the Arbitrum chain remains censorship-resistant, even if the Sequencer misbehaves or excludes certain transactions, refer to [Bypassing the Sequencer](/how-arbitrum-works/02-transaction-lifecycle.mdx#bypassing-the-sequencer) for more details.

Users can send child chain transactions through the delayed inbox in two primary ways:
1. [General child chain messaging](#general-child-chain-messaging)
2. [Retryable tickets](#retryable-tickets)

### General child chain messaging
Any message sent via the delayed inbox can ultimately produce a transaction on the child chain. These messages may or may not include a signature.
* **Signed messages**: Signed by an EOA on the parent chain. This signature proves the sender is an EOA rather than a contract, preventing certain cross-chain exploits and bypassing the need for aliasing.
* **Unsigned messages**: These do not include a signature from an EOA. For security reasons, the sender's address on the child chain must be *aliased* when the message is executed, see the [Address aliasing](#address-aliasing) section for details.

Below we describe the delayed inbox methods for each scenario.

### Signed messages
Signed messages let a parent chain EOA prove ownership of an address, ensuring the child chain transaction will execute with `msg.sender` equal to the *signer's* address on the child chain (rather than an alias). This mechanism is beneficial for bypassing the Sequencer if:
* You want to force-include a transaction on a child chain in case of Sequencer downtime or censorship.
* You need an operation on a child chain that explicitly requires EOA authorization (e.g., a withdrawal).

#### How signed messages work
When submitting through the delayed inbox, a child chain transaction signature gets included in the message's calldata. Because it matches the EOA's signature, the child chain can safely treat the signer's address as the sender.

Example use case:
[Withdraw Ether tutorial](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-tutorials/blob/a1c3f64a5abdd0f0e728cb94d4ecc2700eab7579/packages/delayedInbox-l2msg/scripts/withdrawFunds.js#L61-L65)

#### Delayed inbox methods for signed messages
There are two primary methods for sending signed messages:
1. `sendL2Message`
  * It can be called by either an EOA or a contract
  * The full signed transaction data is emitted in an event log so that nodes can reconstruct the transaction without replaying it
  * More flexible

```solidity
function sendL2Message(
    bytes calldata messageData
) external whenNotPaused onlyAllowed returns (uint256)
```

2. `sendL2MessageFromOrigin`
  * Only an EOA with no deployed code can call this ("codeless origin")
  * The signed transaction is retrieved directly from calldata, so emitting a large event log is unnecessary
  * Offers lower gas costs (cheaper)

```solidity
function sendL2MessageFromOrigin(
    bytes calldata messageData
) external whenNotPaused onlyAllowed returns (uint256);
```

### Unsigned messages
Unsigned messages allow a parent chain sender to specify transaction parameters without an EOA signature. Because there is no signature, **the sender's address must be aliased on the child chain** (see the [Address aliasing](#address-aliasing) section for the rationale). The delayed inbox provides four main methods for unsigned messages, divided based on whether the sender is an EOA or a contract and whether it includes parent chain funds:

1. **Unsigned from EOA's**: These methods incorporate a nonce for replay protection, similar to standard EOA-based transactions on Ethereum.
  * `sendL1FundedUnsignedTransaction`
    * Transfers value from a parent chain to a child chain along with the transaction
    * Parameters: gas limit, fee, nonce, destination address, and calldata

```solidity
function sendL1FundedUnsignedTransaction(
    uint256 gasLimit,
    uint256 maxFeePerGas,
    uint256 nonce,
    address to,
    bytes calldata data
) external payable returns (uint256);
```

  * `sendUnsignedTransaction`
    * No value transfers from the parent chain
    * Transaction fees and value on a child chain come from the child chain balance

```solidity
function sendUnsignedTransaction(
    uint256 gasLimit,
    uint256 maxFeePerGas,
    uint256 nonce,
    address to,
    uint256 value,
    bytes calldata data
) external whenNotPaused onlyAllowed returns (uint256);
```

2. **Unsigned from contracts**: Contracts that typically rely on standard Ethereum replay protection using their contract address.
  * `sendContractTransaction`
    * Sends a transaction from a parent chain with no new funds; uses the contract's existing child chain balance.

```solidity
function sendContractTransaction(
    uint256 gasLimit,
    uint256 maxFeePerGas,
    address to,
    uint256 value,
    bytes calldata data
) external whenNotPaused onlyAllowed returns (uint256);
```

  * `sendL1FundedContractTransaction`
    * Sends the transaction *and* transfers additional funds from a parent to child chain

```solidity
function sendL1FundedContractTransaction(
    uint256 gasLimit,
    uint256 maxFeePerGas,
    address to,
    bytes calldata data
) external payable returns (uint256);
```

In these methods, a "delayed message" is created and passed to the parent chain bridge contract, which then arranges its inclusion on a child chain.

### Messages types
Arbitrum Nitro defines various **message types** to distinguish between the categories described above (signed vs. unsigned, EOAs vs. contracts, etc.). These message types help the protocol route and process each incoming message securely. 

You can find additional details on message types in the next section of this documentation.

:::note

Please refer to the [Address aliasing](#address-aliasing) discussion for more background on address aliasing. This mechanism ensures that a parent chain contract can't impersonate a child chain address unless it provides a vlaid signature as an EOA.

## Retryable tickets
Retryable tickets are Arbitrum's canonical method for creating parent-to-child chain messages, i.e., parent chain transactions that initiate a message to be executed on a child chain. A retryable can be submitted for a fixed-cost (dependent only on its calldata size) paid at the parent chain; its *submission* on the parent chain is separable/asynchronous with its *execution* on the child chain. Retryables provide atomicity between the cross-chain operations; if the parent chain transaction to request submission succeeds (i.e., does not revert) then the execution of the retryable on the child chain has a strong guarantee to ultimately succeed as well.

### Retryable tickets lifecycle
Here we walk through the different stages of the lifecycle of a retryable ticket; (1) submission, (2) auto-redemption, and (3) manual redemption.

#### Submission
1. Creating a retryable ticket is initiated with a call (direct or internal) to the `createRetryableTicket` function of the [`inbox` contract](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro-contracts/blob/67127e2c2fd0943d9d87a05915d77b1f220906aa/src/bridge/Inbox.sol). A ticket is guaranteed to be created if this call succeeds. Here, we describe parameters that need to be carefully set. Note that, this function forces the sender to provide *reasonable* amount of funds (at least enough for submitting, and *attempting* to execute the ticket), but that doesn't guarantee a successful auto-redemption.

| Parameter                                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

2. The sender's deposit must be enough to make the parent chain submission succeed and for child chain execution to be *attempted*. If provided correctly, a new ticket with a unique `TicketID` is created and added to the retryable buffer. Also, funds (`submissionCost` + `l2CallValue`) are deducted from the sender and placed into the escrow for later use in redeeming the ticket.

3. Ticket creation causes the [`ArbRetryableTx`](/build-decentralized-apps/precompiles/reference.mdx#arbretryabletx) precompile to emit a `TicketCreated` event containing the `TicketID` on the child chain.

**Ticket Submission**
1. User initiates a parent-to-child message
2. Initiating a parent-child message
  * A call to `inbox.createRetryableTicket` function that puts the message in the child chain inbox that can be re-executed for some fixed amount of time if it reverts.
3. Check user's deposit
  * Logic that checks if the user has enough funds to create a ticket. This is done by checking if the `msg.value` provided by the user is greater than or equal to `maxSubmissionCost` + `l2CallValue` + `gasLimit` * `maxFeePerGas`.
4. Ticket creation fails and no funds are deducted from the user
5. Ticket creation
  * A ticket is created and added to the retryable buffer on the child chain. Funds (`l2CallValue` + `submissionCost`) are deducted to cover the `callValue` from the user and placed into escrow (on the child chain) for later use in redeeming the ticket.

#### Automatic redemption
1. It is very important to note that the submission of a ticket on the parent chain is separable/asynchronous from its execution on the child chain, i.e., a successful parent chain ticket creation does not guarantee a successful redemption. Once the ticket is successfully created, the two following conditions are checked:
  * if the user's child chain balance is greater than (or equal to) `maxFeePerGas` * `gasLimit` **and**
  * if the `maxFeePerGas` (provided by the user in the ticket submission process) is greater than (or equal to) the `l2BaseFee`. If these conditions are both met, ticket's submission is followed by an attempt to execute it on the child chain (i..e, **auto-redeem** using the supplied gas, as if the `redeem` method of the `[ArbyRetryableTx]` precompile had been called). Depending on how much gas the sender has provided in Step 1, ticket's redemption can either (1) immediately succeed or (2) fail. We explain both situations below:

**Immediate success**

If the ticket is successfully auto-redeemed, it will execute with the sender, destination, callvalue, and calldata of the original submission. The submission fee is refunded to the user on the child chain (`excessFeeRefundAddress`). Note that to ensure successful auto-`redeem` of the ticket, one could use the Arbitrum SDK which provides a [convenience function](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-sdk/blob/4cedb1fcf1c7302a4c3d0f8e75fb33d82bc8338d/src/lib/message/L1ToL2MessageGasEstimator.ts#L215) that returns the desired gas parameters when sending parent-to-child messages.

**Fail**

If a `redeem` is not done at submission or the submission's initial `redeem` fails (for example, because the child chain's gas price has increased unexpectedly), the submission fee is collected on the child chain to cover the resources required to temporarily keep the ticket in memory for a fixed period (one week), and only in this case, a manual redemption of the ticket is required (see the next section).

**Automatic redemption of the `TicketManual` redemption of the ticket**

1. Does the auto-`redeem` succeed?
  * Logic that determines if the user's child chain balance is greater than (or equal to) `maxFeePerGas` * `gasLimit` && `maxFeePerGas` is greater than (or equal to) the `l2BaseFee`.
2. Ticket is executed
  * The actual `submissionFee` is refunded to the `excessFeeRefundAddress` since the ticket was not kept in the buffer on the child chain.
3. Ticket is deleted from the child chain retryable buffer.
4. Refund `callValueRefundAddress`
  * Refunded with (`maxGas` - `gasUsed`) * `gasPrice`. Note that this amount is capped by `l2CallValue` in the auto-`redeem`.

#### Manual redemption
1. At this point, *anyone* can attempt to manually redeem the ticket again by calling [`ArbRetryableTx`](/build-decentralized-apps/precompiles/reference.mdx#arbretryabletx) `redeem` precompile method, which donates the call's gas to the next attempt. Note that the amount of gas is **not** limited by the original `gasLimit` set during the ticket creation. ArbOS will [enqueue the `redeem`](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/fa36a0f138b8a7e684194f9840315d80c390f324/arbos/block_processor.go#L245) before moving on to the next non-`redeem` transaction in the block its forming. In this manner, `redeem`'s are scheduled to happen as soon as possible, and will always be in the same block as the tx that scheduled it. Note that the `redeem` attempt's gas comes from the call to `redeem`, so there's no chance the block's gas limit is reached before execution.

2. If the fixed period (one week) elapses without a successful `redeem`, the ticket **expires** and will be [automatically discarded](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/fa36a0f138b8a7e684194f9840315d80c390f324/arbos/retryables/retryable.go#L262), unless some party has paid a fee to [keep the ticket alive](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro-contracts/blob/a68783436b5105a64f54efe5fbd55174704a7618/src/precompiles/ArbRetryableTx.sol#L41) for another full period. A ticket can live indefinitely as long as it is renewed each time before it expires. 

**Process flow**

1. Is the ticket manually created or not redeemed within seven days?
  * Logic that determines if the ticket is manually cancelled or not redeemed within seven days (i.e., is expired).
2. Refunding `callValueRefundAddress`
  * The `l2CallValue` is refunded to the `callValueRefundAddress`
3. Ticket is deleted from the child chain retryable buffer.
4. Is the ticket manually redeemed?
  * Logic that determines if the ticket is manually redeemed.

#### Avoid losing funds!
If a ticket expires after seven days without being redeemed or re-scheduled to a future date, any message and value (other than the escrowed `callValue`) it carries could be lost without a possbility of being recovered.

On success, the `To` address receives the escrowed `callValue`, and any unused gas is returned to ArbOS's gas pools. On failure, the `callValue` is returned to the escrow for the future `redeem` attempt. In either case, the network fee was paid during the scheduling tx, so no fees are charged and no refunds are made.

Note that during redemption of a ticket, attempts to cancel the same ticket, or to schedule another `redeem` of the same ticket, will revert. In this manner, retryable tickets are not self-modifying.

If a ticket with a `callValue` is eventually discarded (canceled or expired) having never successfully run, the escrowed `callValue` will be paid out to a `callValueRefundAddress` account that was specified in the initial submission (Step 1).

:::info Important notes

If a `redeem` is not done at submission or the submission's initial `redeem` fails, anyone can attempt to redeem the retryable again by calling [`ArbRetryableTx`](/build-decentralized-apps/precompiles/reference.mdx#arbretryabletx) `redeem` precompile method, which donates the call's gas to the next attempt.
* One can `redeem` live tickets using the [Arbitrum Retryables Transaction Panel](https://retryable-dashboard.arbitrum.io/tx)
* The calldata of a ticket is saved on the child chain until it is redeemed or expired
* Redeeming the cost of a ticket will not increase over time, it only depends on the current gas price and gas required for execution.

#### Receipts
In the lifecycle of a retryable ticket, two types of child chain transaction receipts will be emitted:
* **Ticket creation receipt**: This receipt indiates that a ticket was successfully created; any successful parent chain call to the `Inbox`'s `createRetryableTicket` method is guaranteed to create a ticket. The ticket creation receipt includes a `TicketCreated` event (from `ArbRetryableTx`), which includes a `ticketId` field. This `ticketId` is compuatable via RLP encoding an hasing the transaction; see `[calculateSubmitRetryableId]`(https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-sdk/blob/6cc143a3bb019dc4c39c8bcc4aeac9f1a48acb01/src/lib/message/L1ToL2Message.ts#L109).
* **`redeem` attempt**: A `redeem` attempt receipt represents the results of an attempted child chain execution of a ticket, i.e., success/failure of that specified `redeem` attempt. It includes a `RedeemScheduled` event from `ArbRetryableTx`, with a `ticketId` field. At most, one successful `redeem` attempt can ever exist for a given ticket; if, e.g., the auto-`redeem` upon initial creation succeeds, only the receipt from the auto-`redeem` will ever get emitted for that ticket. If the auto-`redeem` fails (or was never attempted–i.e., the provided child chain gas limit * child chain gas price = 0), each initial attempt will emit a `redeem` attempt receipt until one succeeds.

#### Alternative "unsafe" retryable ticket creation
The `Inbox.createRetryableTicket` convenience method includes anity checks to help minimize the risk of user error: the method will ensure that enough funds are provided directly from a parent chain to cover the current cost of ticket creation. It also will convert the provided `callValueRefundAddress` and `excessFeeRefundAddress` to their [address alias](#address-aliasing) if either is a contract (determined by if the address has code during the call), providing a path for the parent chain contract to recover funds. A power-user may bypass these sanity-check measures via the `Inbox`'s `unsafeCreateRetryableTicket` method; as the method's name desperately attempts to warn you, it should only be accessed by a user who truly knows what they are doing.
