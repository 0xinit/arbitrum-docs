## Introduction


### Prerequisites

Before implementing inheritance, ensure you have:

<CustomDetails summary="Rust toolchain">

Follow the instructions on [Rust Lang's installation page](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) to install a complete Rust toolchain (v1.81 or newer) on your system. After installation, ensure you can access the programs `rustup`, `rustc`, and `cargo` from your preferred terminal application.

</CustomDetails>

<CustomDetails summary="cargo stylus">

In your terminal, run:

```shell
cargo install --force cargo-stylus
```

Add WASM ([WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/)) as a build target for the specific Rust toolchain you are using. The below example sets your default Rust toolchain to 1.81 as well as adding the WASM build target:

```shell
rustup default 1.81
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown --toolchain 1.81
```

You can verify that cargo stylus is installed by running `cargo stylus --help` in your terminal, which will return a list of helpful commands.
