This guide will get you started with <a data-quicklook-from="stylus">Stylus</a>' basics. We'll cover the following steps:

## Setting up your development environment

### Prerequisites

<details>
<summary>Rust toolchain</summary>

Follow the instructions on [Rust Lang's installation page](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) to install a complete Rust toolchain (v1.81 or older, v1.82 is currently not supported) on your system. After installation, ensure you can access the programs `rustup`, `rustc`, and `cargo` from your preferred terminal application.

</details>

<details>
<summary>VS Code</summary>

We recommend [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as the IDE of choice for its excellent Rust support, but feel free to use another text editor or IDE if you're comfortable with those.

Some helpful VS Code extensions for Rust development:

- [rust-analyzer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer): Provides advanced features like smart code completion and on-the-fly error checks
- [Error Lens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=usernamehw.errorlens): Immediately highlights errors and warnings in your code
- [Even Better TOML](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tamasfe.even-better-toml): Improves syntax highlighting and other features for TOML files, often used in Rust projects
- [Dependi](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=fill-labs.dependi): Helps manage Rust crate versions directly from the editor

 </details>

<details>
<summary>Docker</summary>

The testnode we will use as well as some `cargo stylus` commands require Docker to operate.

You can download Docker from [Docker's website](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

</details>

<details>
<summary>Foundry's Cast</summary>

[Foundry's Cast](https://book.getfoundry.sh/cast/) is a command-line tool that allows you to interact with your EVM contracts.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Nitro devnode</summary>

Stylus is available on Arbitrum Sepolia, but we'll use nitro devnode which has a pre-funded wallet saving us the effort of wallet provisioning or running out of tokens to send transactions.

```shell title="Install your devnode"
git clone https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro-devnode.git
cd nitro-devnode
```

```shell title="Launch your devnode"
./run-dev-node.sh
```

</details>

[cargo stylus](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/cargo-stylus/blob/main/main/VALID_WASM.md) is a CLI toolkit built to facilitate the development of Stylus contracts.

It is available as a plugin to the standard cargo tool used for developing Rust programs.

### Installing cargo stylus

In your terminal, run:

```shell
cargo install --force cargo-stylus
```

Add WASM ([WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/)) as a build target for the specific Rust toolchain you are using. The below example sets your default Rust toolchain to 1.80 as well as adding the WASM build target:

```shell
rustup default 1.80
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown --toolchain 1.80
```

You can verify that cargo stylus is installed by running `cargo stylus --help` in your terminal, which will return a list of helpful commands, we will use some of them in this guide:

```shell title="cargo stylus --help returns:"
