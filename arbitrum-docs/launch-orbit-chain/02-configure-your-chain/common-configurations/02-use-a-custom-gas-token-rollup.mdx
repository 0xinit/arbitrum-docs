Custom gas token support for rollups is currently limited to L2s with BoLD enabled; support for L3s is expected to be enabled in a future upgrade

:::

When deploying an Orbit chain in [Rollup mode](https://docs.arbitrum.io/how-arbitrum-works/data-availability#rollup-mode), you have the option of using a custom ERC-20 token as the native gas token. This token can be used to pay for transaction fees on that specific Orbit chain and to reimburse the batch poster for data posted to the parent chain. An example would be an L2 Rollup that uses USDC as its custom gas token but pays ETH to post data to L1 Ethereum.

Enabling a custom fee token for a Rollup chain requires additional configuration compared to an [AnyTrust chain](https://docs.arbitrum.io/launch-orbit-chain/configure-your-chain/common-configurations/use-a-custom-gas-token); it also introduces important exchange-rate considerations. This guide outlines certain implementation steps and operational considerations for chain owners or operators to consider when enabling a custom fee token for rollups.

## Requirements of the custom gas token

- must be a standard ERC-20 token;
- transfers and approvals must occur directly via the token contract, not via proxies or hooks;
- must not be rebasing or include transfer fees; and
- must not use transfer callbacks or any onchain behavior that reverts if the sender and recipient are the same

## Understanding the fee token pricer

In Rollup mode, data posting costs to the parent chain are paid in the parent chain’s native token, but are reimbursed in the child chain’s fee token. To facilitate this, you must deploy and register a fee token pricer contract, which will provide an exchange rate between the two tokens (child fee token and parent fee token). This exchange rate is used when computing the amount of custom fee tokens required to reimburse the batch poster for each batch posted to the parent chain.

Below are three example implementation options that chain owners may consider; chain owners are free to develop their own custom fee token pricers. Please note that the implementations included in the examples below have not been audited nor comprehensively tested; they are meant to provide an illustration of some different options for chain owners to consider.

1. **Manual exchange rate**: the chain owner manually sets and updates the exchange rate; this is the simplest option, but requires manual updates to track price changes or dependence on an owner-defined oracle.
    
    This approach generally makes sense if:
    - You as the chain owner want full control over the exchange rate
    - The chain owner and the batch poster are the same entity
    - You are operating in a tightly controlled or experimental environment
    
    An (unaudited) example to reference is: [OwnerAdjustableExchangeRatePricer.sol](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro-contracts/blob/main/test/foundry/fee-token-pricers/OwnerAdjustableExchangeRatePricer.sol)

2. **External oracle**: an external oracle is used to fetch the exchange rate; this reduces operational requirements for the chain owner but introduces a dependency on an external service to provide accurate, reliable pricing data.

    This approach generally makes sense if:
    - Reliable, robust oracles are available for the gas token pair
    - Reducing trust in the chain owner is important for your implementation
    - You as the chain owner want to avoid manual exchange rate updates

    See an (unaudited) example here using a TWAP oracle: [UniswapV2TwapPricer.sol](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro-contracts/blob/main/test/foundry/fee-token-pricers/uniswap-v2-twap/UniswapV2TwapPricer.sol)

3. **Exchange rate tracking**: the batch poster records the actual rate used when converting the child gas token to the parent gas token; this approach can ensure accurate reimbursement but it also requires trusted reporting and more complex accounting.

    This approach generally makes sense if:
    - Your batch poster is trusted and willing to record exchange rates when purchasing parent chain gas
    - You want reimbursement to be precise and not over- or under-charge users
    - You want to minimize reliance on the chain owner or external oracles
	
    Consider this (unaudited) example: [TradeTracker.sol](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro-contracts/blob/main/test/foundry/fee-token-pricers/trade-tracker/TradeTracker.sol)

An important risk for chain owners to consider is exchange rate stability. If the fee token pricer returns stale or manipulated prices, the batch poster may be under- or over-reimbursed. While this risk may be acceptable for experimental or early stage chains, the financial consequences for the batch poster and for end users on your Orbit chain should be carefully considered. The “External oracle” and the “Exchange rate tracking” approaches seek to mitigate this risk. Ultimately, the chain owner should take their unique situation into account when determining which fee pricer strategy makes the most sense for them (if any).

## Configuration of the Rollup when using a custom gas token

Here are the steps you should take for deploying your Orbit Rollup with a custom gas token:
1. **Deploy your ERC-20 token (if not already deployed)**
2. **Deploy your fee token pricer**
    Choose a pricer approach that best meets your needs; unaudited examples are:
    - [OwnerAdjustableExchangeRatePricer.sol](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro-contracts/blob/main/test/foundry/fee-token-pricers/OwnerAdjustableExchangeRatePricer.sol)
    - [UniswapV2TwapPricer.sol](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro-contracts/blob/main/test/foundry/fee-token-pricers/uniswap-v2-twap/UniswapV2TwapPricer.sol)
    - [TradeTracker.sol](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro-contracts/blob/main/test/foundry/fee-token-pricers/trade-tracker/TradeTracker.sol)
    
    Make sure the pricer is deployed on the parent chain.
3. **Configure the fee token and pricer when creating the rollup**
    Use the [createERC20Rollup.ts](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro-contracts/blob/main/scripts/createERC20Rollup.ts) script, which accepts environment variables for:
    - FEE_TOKEN_ADDRESS = your ERC-20 gas token
    - FEE_TOKEN_PRICER_ADDRESS = your deployed pricer
    - ROLLUP_CREATOR_ADDRESS = the rollup creator contract on L1
    - STAKE_TOKEN_ADDRESS = token used for staking (see [BoLD docs](https://docs.arbitrum.io/launch-orbit-chain/bold-adoption-for-orbit-chains#use-of-your-projects-native-token-as-the-bonding-asset-to-secure-the-chain) for more details)

    The script will deploy and initialize the rollup accordingly.
