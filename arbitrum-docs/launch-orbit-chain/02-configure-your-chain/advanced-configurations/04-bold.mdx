<a data-quicklook-from="bold">Arbitrum BoLD</a> is the latest iteration of the Optimistic Rollup Dispute
Protocol used by Arbitrum chains today, like Arbitrum One. This page is intended for Orbit chain owners/operators
and assumes knowledge of Arbitrum BoLD is and experience upgrading
an Arbitrum chain's rollup contracts.{' '}

To read more about what Arbitrum BoLD is, please refer to the [Gentle Introduction for BoLD](../../../how-arbitrum-works/bold/gentle-introduction.mdx). To learn more about some guidelines/best-practices for using BoLD on your Orbit chain, please refer to our guide on [BoLD Adoption for Orbit chains](../../bold-adoption-for-orbit-chains.mdx).

:::caution
As mentioned in our guide on [BoLD Adoption for Orbit chains](../../bold-adoption-for-orbit-chains.mdx), it is highly recommended that Orbit chains keep validation permissione by having `disableValidatorWhitelist` be `false` (which is the default) and by having a list of validators on the whitelist via the `validators[]` array.
