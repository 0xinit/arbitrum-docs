## In which case you need to customize ArbOS upgrade

First, when you make changes to your nitro code and it may affect State Transition Function (You can refer to [Customize STF](./customize-stf.mdx#Preface)), 

Second, if your Orbit Chain is not started for the first time but the changes are made while it is running.

If your changes meet both those 2 points, then you need to customize the ArbOS upgrade.

Also, if you added some changes to the chain and want to upgrade them at some time in the future. You should also take it into ArbOS upgrade process.

## Where should I insert ArbOS Upgrade related code?
Here we give you 4 examples that need to add ArbOS Upgrade related code:

### 1. Add a new method to exsiting precompile on a specific ArbOS version:

After you add `sayHi()` to `ArbSys.go` according to the guide in [customize precompile option 1](./customize-precompile.mdx#option-1-Add-new-methods-to-an-existing-precompile),
you need continue to modify [precompile.go][precompile_main_file_link]. 

For example, the original code is
```go
ArbSys := insert(MakePrecompile(pgen.ArbSysMetaData, &ArbSys{Address: types.ArbSysAddress}))
arbos.ArbSysAddress = ArbSys.address
arbos.L2ToL1TransactionEventID = ArbSys.events["L2ToL1Transaction"].template.ID
arbos.L2ToL1TxEventID = ArbSys.events["L2ToL1Tx"].template.ID
```
You need to write after it
```go
ArbSys := insert(MakePrecompile(pgen.ArbSysMetaData, &ArbSys{Address: types.ArbSysAddress}))
arbos.ArbSysAddress = ArbSys.address
arbos.L2ToL1TransactionEventID = ArbSys.events["L2ToL1Transaction"].template.ID
arbos.L2ToL1TxEventID = ArbSys.events["L2ToL1Tx"].template.ID
// The arbos version control logic
ArbOwner.methodsByName["SayHi"].arbosVersion = ${The arbos version you want to activate this method}
```
In this way, this method will be executed normally and return results only after you update ArbOS to the target version.

### 2. Create a new precompile contract on a specific ArbOS version
After you add a new precompile named `ArbHi` according to the guide in [customize precompile option 2](./customize-precompile.mdx#option-2-create-a-new-precompile) and make changes to [precompile.go][precompile_main_file_link], 
you also need to make the following changes:
```
ArbHi := insert(MakePrecompile(pgen.ArbHiMetaData, &ArbHi{Address: types.ArbHiAddress})) // types.ArbHiAddress here is an example address
// Set activate version to the precompile
ArbHi.arbosVersion = ${The arbos version you want to activate this precompile}
// Set activate version to all method
for _, method := range ArbHi.methods {
   method.arbosVersion = ${The arbos version you want to activate this precompile}
}
```
In this way, ArbHi and all its methods will be activated after the ArbOS version you set.

### 3. Create a new ArbOS state on a specific ArbOS version

After you add a new state `myNumber` according to the guide in [customize precompile Option 5](./customize-precompile.mdx#option-5-call-and-modify-state), you also need to rewrite [UpgradeArbosVersion][arbosstate_updatearbosversion_method_link] in [arbosstate.go][arbosstate_file_link]:
Add your expected ArbOS version to the switch case statement of nextArbosVersion. Here we will take ArbOS V21 as an example:
```
case 21:
			ensure(state.SetNewMyNumber(${random number}))
```
Here, we will ensure that the initial value of ${random number} after ArbOS is upgraded to V21.


:::caution
It should be noted that when you initialize the state (initial code is in [customize precompile Option 5](./customize-precompile.mdx#option-5-call-and-modify-state)), you need to initialize it to 0 or null value first to avoid potential blockchain reorg.
:::

And, please make sure that your program cannot call the `state.SetNewMyNumber` or other function might change the value of `myNumber` before ArbOS V21. 
To prevent this, if you are using an external call to the precompile contract to change the value, you can refer to 1 or 2 to set the activation time of the precompile contract method.
If your nitro code needs to call this method to change the state, you can continue reading point 4.

### 4. Any changes in the stf logic that will affect the final execution result
If you change the logic in STF and it will cause the execution result of the transaction to be different, 
you need to keep the original execution logic and put the new logic into another branch.
You can use `if else` statement to control it.
For example, we change the `SayHi` return after upgrade the ArbOS version:
```go
// The method in ArbHi precompile
func (con *ArbHi) SayHi(c ctx, evm mech) (string, error) {
    if p.state.ArbOSVersion() >= ${The arbos you want to upgrade to} {
        // Your new logic code
        return "hi, new ArbOS version", nil
    } else {
        // The old logic code needs to be kept
        return "hi", nil
    }
}
```

## Schedule ArbOS upgrade
After you add ArbOS version control to the nitro code, you can update ArbOS. You can refer to the document ArbOS upgrade to upgrade.
It should be noted that if you set a higher ArbOS version as the upgrade target, all the features added between the current version and the target version will be activated.
For example, if your current version is ArbOS v18 and you set the target version to v25, then all the features between v18 and v25 will be loaded.

## Upgrade WASM Module Root on parent chain
Afterwards, since Arbitrum needs to make a fraud proof on the parent chain, you need to update the Wasm Module Root recorded on the parent chain.
Please continue reading [customize stf](./customize-stf.mdx#step-3-run-the-node-without-fraud-proofs) for follow-up operations.
